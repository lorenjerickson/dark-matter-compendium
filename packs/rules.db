Was it the blobby Amoeboids?”</p>\n<p>   “No!” the eager group of children responded in unison.</p>\n<p>   “Was it the silly Bird-People?”</p>\n<p>   “No!” the children repeated.</p>\n<p>   \"Was it the beepy-boopy Vect?”</p>\n<p>   “No!” the children cried, sensing the end of storytime.</p>\n<p>   “No, it was the scary Wroth!” the teacher grimaced and growled, “It grinned with its sharp teeth and grabbed Alice and Bobby with its pointy nails!”</p>\n<p><em>— A spacer’s storytime</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When most spacers are young, they hear a bedtime story about the wroth: fearsome invaders from beyond the stars that come by night to steal away bad little girls and boys. When they grow up, however, they only learn that the tale is far more terrible in reality.</p>\n<p>   The dreaded wroth perhaps originate in the Black, for that is where they reside: in the endless space between worlds, where they can never be located and destroyed. They are a blight on the galaxy, arriving by night upon defenseless worlds to take humanoid captives with their ruthless alien machines, and slaughtering anyone that resists. When they are satisfied with their cruelty, they retreat with their captives, who are never to be seen again, into the interminable Black.</p>\n<p>   The very word \"wroth\" can cause panic on Frontier worlds, where defenses are few and far between, but the wroth prey on worlds everywhere, from the galactic center to the uttermost edge of the 'verse. And as such, they are universally feared and despised.</p>\n<h2>Imperfect Rogue</h2>\n<p>Most consider wrothians to be wholly evil, an utter scourge of the Black; but by some providence, you were born different. Like all wrothian drones, you are created imperfect, using a fraction of the bio-matter allotted to the unholy primarchs. These primarchs rule over your kind, commanding you to go to the small, pale worlds below and take people to harvest their bio-matter and brains.</p>\n<p>   Perhaps you were exiled from your ship for demonstrating some act of mercy, or perhaps you escaped to free yourself from the oppressive primarch regime. Regardless, you are now a Rogue, an enemy of all wroth and feared by all others.</p>\n<h2>Few Friends, Many Enemies</h2>\n<p>As a wrothian, there is no bastion you can call home, and you have no natural allies in the ‘verse. Depending on the circumstances of your exile, it is even possible you will be hunted by your former brethren.</p>\n<p>   You might find company with groups of mercenaries and among adventuring parties which value your particular skills. Spacers tend to be wary around wrothians and wrothian technology, but, especially on the Galactic Frontier where hazards are abundant, a wrothian might be able to earn a crew’s trust, provided they can prove their worth as an ally.</p>\n<p>   Most rogue wrothians, however, use disguises; usually of magical caliber. Even a simple disguise self spell can reliably masquerade a wrothian as another exotic species, such as a nautilid or skathári, for a time.</p>\n<h2>Awaiting Oblivion</h2>\n<p>In abandoning your life with the wroth, you have forsaken your immortality. Without the refreshment of psionic energy found on their ships, your body will break down and die in less than a decade. Perhaps this death will be a mercy to you, a final correction of your life's mistake, or perhaps you will seek some darker alternative to the oblivion that is death. At long last, however, your life's objective is your own, your destiny free to decide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Wrothian\" data-language=\"wrothian\">“Fly, fools! The primarchs have ordered that this system be harvested! Do not let my warning be in vain...”</span></p>\n<p>—— Aa'xooras, wrothian exile</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Wrothian Names</h2>\n<p>Names aren't bestowed on wrothian takers when they are created; under the primarchs, they have only silent, psionic designations that more closely resemble numbers. Rogue wrothians, however, choose their own names when they break free. These names tend to sound harsh, borrowing sounds from the Wrothian language, but carry great personal meaning to the wrothian that selected it.</p>\n<p><em>Wrothian Names</em>. Ax’omn, Bael’deldist, Falct’maelom, Hry’steriost, Knu’crikolp, Saluh’ark, Tas’garnaacta, Troh’gelt, Vaek’lenthar, Xrau’tsidea, Zred’rrirc</p>\n<h2>Wrothian Traits</h2>\n<p>Almost completely uniform, wrothian takers that reject the primarchs have the following racial traits:</p>\n<p><em>Ability Score Increase</em>. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma increases by 1.</p>\n<p><em>Age</em>. All wrothians are synthetically engineered in a creation matrix, which rids them of the faults found in other organic lifeforms: they are ageless and don't require food or drink, as long as they are nourished by a field of psionic energy, such as those which encompass their ships. In exile from your ship, however, you will find no such nourishment, and will likely perish within 10 years.</p>\n<p><em>Alignment</em>. Wrothians have always found the conceit of morality strange. After all, to their minds, all other life in the 'verse is simply beneath them, so empathy and other philosophical considerations are a waste of thought. As a rogue wrothian, you likely oppose the primarchs and their view, but a natural understanding of empathy might elude you, for your mind wasn't designed for it. Rogue wrothians can have alignments across the spectrum, but many skew toward evil out of habit.</p>\n<p><em>Size</em>. All takers stand the same height—just over six feet tall—and are identical in every other dimension as well, though you might have some important defect that distinguishes you. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em>Speed</em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Darkvision</em>. Accustomed to the endless, inimitable Black, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.r-feats.INGVyUtuT6Abp2uI]{Neural Lock}</em>. You can use your action to freeze the nervous system of a humanoid creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn. After you use your neural lock, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.r-feats.C1Oe5NytiesZf956]{Razor Teeth}</em>. Your sharp claws and teeth are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing or piercing damage (your choice) equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>\n<p><em>Repletion</em>. In lieu of a true digestive system, your body is sustained by psionic energy it absorbed while aboard your ship. You don't need to eat or drink, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.</p>\n<p><em>Telepathy</em>. You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.</p>\n<p><em>Languages</em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and Wrothian. Wrothian is a language rarely spoken, and is written in complex, circular runes. Spoken aloud, it is a rhythmic language of rumbles, sibilants, and chirps, suited to a race with an articulate tongue.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/wrothian-warlock-sm.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.v0wiiqAkXFYAJoX1"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ktslxkevw8","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"3zJTX0kv1IK6CQ4z","name":"Faction - The Cabal","content":"<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-cabal.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"251\" /></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;For one percent, you can expect a one-time payment of 2,000 credits, but we&rsquo;re running a special on the three percent package, which I think you&rsquo;ll find enticing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;&mdash; Odile Fournier, Cabal Soul Broker</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Across the &lsquo;verse, the Cabal is synonymous with devil-summoning and unholy bargains, but to say that they&rsquo;re evil would be an outright exaggeration. The Cabal is an enterprising office of soul brokers, who arrange lucrative contracts in exchange for parts of a signee&rsquo;s soul. Such contracts are fair, clearly spelled-out, and never offered unsolicited; moreover, most contracts exchange only a percentage of the signee&rsquo;s soul for a disbursement. One percent of a soul could be worth a few thousand credits, whereas ten percent could buy a brand-new starship, place a down payment on a house, and leave some left over in the bank. Signees are free to decide from a number of generous disbursement packages and receive prompt payment for their souls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This method of soul contracting isn't just efficient, but it represents a triumph of the free market. The soul brokers who work for the Cabal need not worry about signing mortal bargains for entire souls at once; they each collect dozens of souls a year, taken from hundreds of different signees. Those who sign such contracts need not worry about being damned to the Lower Planes for eternity as a part of their bargain; instead, they can (probably) expect their afterlives will be merely tarnished, as only part of their eternal soul ascends. They can even return to sign additional contracts. Best of all, the process doesn&rsquo;t require any tiresome blood rituals or fiendish temptation, as the Cabal operates out of ordinary office buildings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cabal was founded by Mr. Bell, secretly a highranking devil named Belphagor. At the time he arrived on the Material Plane, soul trading was a clumsy affair, requiring a creature to trade its entire soul for one favor, which was rarely as valuable as the soul itself. While this system meant that devils almost always profited on their deals, it also meant that far fewer creatures were willing to barter with them. To remedy this, Belphagor derived the exact monetary value for a mortal soul and a system by which to trade away only a small portion of it. Before long, human greed and the free market ran away with the idea. Belphagor no longer needed to send imps to haggle with mortals; they were coming to him. Under the guise of Mr. Bell, he purchased an office, hired a staff of tieflings, and opened for business as the Cabal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cabal will hire anyone that passes the prerequisite legal and brokerage exams, but prefers tiefling employees for their natural silver tongues and infernal blood. Soul brokers can also be hired to oversee other legal matters, as most soul brokers become qualified lawyers before taking the brokerage exams.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-cabal.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.5x58CJb08g0RzGH6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_1wcsmr9yxis","color":"#000000"}}}

The Temple of the Chosen venerates a diverse pantheon of spacefarers, who each, it is said, ascended from their mortal forms and attained godhood, granting them dominion over the entire galaxy. This pantheon, known as the Chosen, contains no names, only titles corresponding to their god&rsquo;s position aboard their celestial spacecraft, the Ark:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Captain</em>. Usually depicted as a human male, the Captain gives orders to his celestial crew, and is in turn supported by them.</li>\n<li><em>The First Mate</em>. Often depicted as an elven female, the First Mate advises the Captain and critiques his decisions, but also enforces them should they be deemed proper and good.</li>\n<li><em>The Pilot</em>. A female gnome, the Pilot flies the Ark through the Black, deftly avoiding all obstacles.</li>\n<li><em>The Astrogator</em>. The Astrogator is typically a male avia-ra and guides the Pilot through the stars, ensuring she always knows the correct path to fly.</li>\n<li><em>The Cook</em>. A male halfling, the Cook provides celestial sustenance to the crew, and fatherly advice to all who desire it.</li>\n<li><em>The Doc</em>. The Doc, depicted as a female half-orc, tends to the wounds and fatigue of the crew, and keeps her charges healthy and fit.</li>\n<li><em>The Engineer</em>. The Engineer, a dwarven male, keeps the engines of the Ark running at all times, and ensures stability of all of the Ark&rsquo;s myriad celestial systems.</li>\n<li><em>The Stowaway</em>. Hidden away within the Ark&rsquo;s vast hangars, the Stowaway, a skath&aacute;ri female, remembers the old ways of nature and survival.</li>\n<li><em>The Gunner</em>. A tiefling of ambiguous gender, the Gunner manages the powerful weapons attached to the Ark and brings them to bear against those who seek to challenge it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is difficult, however, to parse religion in absolutes. Some people believe the Chosen and their Ark are merely a metaphor, a guideline by which to live a more perfect life. Others, however, believe the Chosen to be real, immortal beings traveling the universe in an omnipotent ship. Historians, meanwhile, suggest that the story of the Chosen and the Ark might be loosely derived from some ancient tale of a real ship that underwent a fateful journey past the edge of the galaxy and never returned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever the truth is, the Temple adheres strictly to the belief that the Chosen are divinity, whose celestial ship grants them dominion over all worlds in the 'verse. According to Temple doctrine, the faithful are guided to the Ark after death, where they might join the Chosen on their celestial journey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/temple-of-the-chosen.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.lv9CgfzessgH6k7k"},"cf":{"id":"temp_1wcsmr9yxis","color":"#000000"}}}

Coming and going in the middle of the night to dissect livestock and experiment on intelligent creatures, amoeboid ships are somewhat infamous for their role in researching primitive worlds. More often, however, amoeboid saucers and motherships can be found hovering around and leaping between maw stations, their symmetric, sophisticated designs perfectly reflecting that of most amoeboid technology, including much of the maws themselves.</p>\n<h2>Avia-Ra Ships</h2>\n<p>The mighty arm of the avia-ra in the Holy Lands is the Congregation, a fleet of righteous ships dedicated to carrying the fury and enlightenment of the Sun Above to heretics the universe over. Its flagship, The Prophet, is a vessel of terrifying might, and is said to have burned its mark into every elven ship it crossed during the days of the Night Crusade. Now, it slumbers peacefully with much of the Congregation in a large perimeter around the Sepulcher Star, awaiting another grand Crusade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avia-Ra ships demonstrate a meeting of traditional design, canny ingenuity, and startling ruthlessness. There is no better evidence of this than the scorchers borne by most ships in the Congregation: a powerful symbol of the Sun's might, and also a deceptively simple circumvention of elven shield technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;When you see that ship&rsquo;s firepower, you can feel it in your bones.&rdquo;<br />&mdash; Dietrich Hildbrand, human mercenary captain, on seeing The Prophet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Dwarven Ships</h2>\n<p>Dwarven shipwrights are renowned for their craftsmanship and engineering, and as such, dwarven ships are the gold standard for quality and dependability. If properly maintained, a dwarven vessel can see centuries of continuous use, long outliving its creators. These machines are designed to tackle tough jobs&mdash;asteroid mining, interstellar hauling, and deep space salvage&mdash;and are named appropriately, but never seem to break down; indeed, they almost seem to perform better when the going gets rough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwarven starship designs and innovations have been adapted and emulated by all comers, leaving the marks of Jormund engineers on human, vect, and avia-ra ships.</p>\n<h2>Elven Ships</h2>\n<p>Elven ships aren't so much constructed as grown, shaped from living ironwood trees. Indeed, there are few vessels in existence that can match an elven ship for beauty or speed. Many are made to resemble traditional sailing ships, with similar bows, sails, and open decks, but all components are formed from great boughs and limbs of ironwood. Pound for pound, no metal can match ironwood for strength, and elven ships rely on this strength and lightness to achieve extreme maneuverability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As elven ships grow larger, they become more arboreal, with weapons mounted in high limbs and engines fixed in the deepest roots. The grandest of vessels, such as The Hyperion, are thriving cities in their own right, centers of arcane knowledge, and symbols of elven superiority for the rest of the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<h2>Gnomish Ships</h2>\n<p>A bitter diatribe on prevailing magical technology, gnomish vessels are the epitome of high-tech, cruising through the stars without so much as an arcane battery. As such, gnomes can fly without hindrance into Dead Magic Zones and can penetrate deep into the uncharted territory beyond. The largest Dead Magic Zones even provide some measure of protection for the Gnomish Flotilla, the permanent armada of gnomish ships, and demonstrate the spite most gnomes hold for magic in general: even approaching the Flotilla from the wrong angle will strand an ordinary ship without power in the Black, a death sentence for those who are not promptly rescued.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advances and complexities of gnomish ships are due to their growing mastery of a baffling art known as science. Guided by this philosophy, gnomish ships are apt to follow different naming conventions: blasters are more likely to be called lasers, sickbays are more likely to be called hospitals, and so on.</p>\n<h2>Human Ships</h2>\n<p>When humans look at the vast emptiness of space, they&rsquo;re not crushed by a weight of burden, nor are they confounded by its meaning; they are instead overwhelmed by an urge to explore. Humans are a young race in the grand scheme of things, but they have made leaps and bounds technologically, bolstering the Hegemony and setting human spacecraft apart from others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic almost to a fault, human ships are always purpose-driven in form. Freelancers excel for lone agents, Explorers can probe the farthest depths of space, and Warbringers are utterly ruthless in combat. Regardless of intended function, human ships are innovative and rugged, capable of meeting any trial the &lsquo;verse throws their way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We're seeking out new life and civilizations. To blow them to pieces. Welcome to The Antioch, Hegemony warbringer, heavy cruiser class.\"<br />&mdash; Admiral Banebridge's introduction to civilians touring The Antioch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Lakshayan Ships</h2>\n<p>The Lakshayan people are warriors, ever battle-hardened against the Warhorde, and their ships are a testament to their readiness. In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just a ship, a Lakshayan battle frame is an extension of the pilot, and using one is a dance of tactical maneuvers and precision strikes. The deadliest Lakshayan pilots, called Oni, are as fearsome in person as they are in a frame.</p>\n<h2>Nautilid Ships</h2>\n<p>Lonely nautilid whorl ships wander the galaxy, searching for a world that might not even exist. When their homeworld of Poseidon was destroyed, the only haven left to the nautilid race were their immense ships, filled with the rare aqueous solution in which they can thrive. Indeed, whereas other ships and life suits are designed to withhold a volume of air, nautilid ships and suits are pumped with water and a cocktail of minerals specific to their race. Visitors to nautilid ships, therefore, need to prepare as if going on a deep dive or a spacewalk before coming aboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of whorl ships, and the smaller pincer ships, are inspired by the long-dead undersea creatures of Poseidon; their hulls resemble great shells, and their landing gear, immense legs. True to their name, pincers are even armed with immense crab claws, capable of shredding smaller craft in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<h2>Orc Ships</h2>\n<p>Never let it be said that orc ships aren't at least effective. Industrial in the sense that they run on gasoline, coal, and other crude sources, orc ships spout smoke and sputter flame as they tear across the sky. These pragmatic design influences are matched with strictly aesthetic ones: an orcish rig can usually be found with attractive accessories and an eye-catching paint job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other goblinoids, including bugbears and goblins, also tend to tend to use general orc ship designs, but take far less care with the workmanship, leading to uneven hulls and barely-stable Dark Matter cores. These ships have garnered the moniker &ldquo;scrap ships&rdquo;, whereas true orc ships are called &ldquo;rigs&rdquo; or &ldquo;rides&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the model, a small contingent of orc ships make a ready fighting force, as they are sensibly built and battle-tested in the Warzone.</p>\n<h2>Vect Ships</h2>\n<p>No craft in existence works precisely like a vect ship. Utilitarian to the point of volatility, vect ships abandon all systems and features not strictly related to their operation, forgoing even life-support; after all, vect don't need to breathe, and the exposed arcane engines powering their ships provide just enough heat to keep the pilot from freezing to death. Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the centuries following the Night Crusade and the liberation of vect in the galaxy, most vect ships have been decommissioned&mdash;their volatility proving to be too much of a liability for everyday use. But some militant splinter cells of vect, often separatists or religious zealots, can still be found employing the designs, which, though inherently nstable, are extremely formidable in combat.</p>\n<h2>Wrothian Ships</h2>\n<p>Wrothian ships are like a thing out of a nightmare. Their inky black shells are almost featureless, with smooth<br />curves that lend them an alien silhouette from every angle. But within those shells is something even stranger: a living, organic interior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as other wrothian technology, like collection vats and brains in a jar, is alive with a kind of bestial intelligence, so too are their ships. On the inside, the chitinous black exoskeletons give way to tough, crimson tissue that lines the walls and hallways. Structures of black chitin form biomechanical interfaces, devices, rooms, and hallways. A stygian ship can nearly pilot itself, but is driven by psionic impulse from wrothian primarchs, who reside near the ship's nervous center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ships are nourished by the same psionic energy that sustains the wroth themselves; they are integral to the wrothian lifecycle. Deep in the Black, the wroth inhabit their stygian ships, emerging only to raid planets for humanoids, harvesting them for their bio-matter and minds. These minds are processed into brains in a jar, whose psionic potential nourishes the ships and the wrothians themselves, perpetuating the cycle.</p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Ships</h2>\n<p>The following ships are evidence of convergent design in action: whereas flying cars, freighters, and space stations are constructed by engineers of every race, the most efficient designs transcend industrial trends favored by different empires. Though an elven flying car might be made of sleek ironwood and a dwarven one would feature hard angles and a more spacious trunk, they're both more alike than they are different, and consequently share the same statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic but inefficient designs also belong in this category. The Battle Planetoid, for example, is an asteroid or small moon retrofitted with engines, life support, and a small Dark Matter engine. Though utterly impractical, goblins, kobolds, and other small races have utilized this design time and again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exception to this rule is a ship that literally belongs nowhere else: the Infinity is a legendary vessel, made by no race living today. Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps. It is an enigma; perhaps a relic of an ancient galactic empire, a visitor from another galaxy, or something even stranger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.SOl4IaK5fNBn7gCt"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dq06gap2egm","color":"#000000"}}}

Those in the know, however, understand that, for all its business accoutrement, the Firm is the largest organized crime syndicate in the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To conduct its various illegal operations, which include hacking, weapons trafficking, and elaborate heists, the Firm hires short-term Contractors, individuals speciallyrecruited to match the details of a particular job. Contractors are abundant and varied, including everyone from expert hackers to common thugs, but all are expected to follow their contracts to the letter, regardless of what deeds they entail. Many Contractors even play the part of businessmen with aplomb. By their nature, Contractors are compartmentalized and ultimately expendable; no single Contractor knows details which might incriminate the Firm&rsquo;s Management, and if they become a problem, their contract can be terminated, usually via unprotected spacewalk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the shadowy nature of the Firm&rsquo;s dealings, concrete details on its Management can be hard to come by. Rumors abound, however, that the Firm&rsquo;s Middle-Managers can be tracked down on Hearthstations across the &lsquo;verse. Of course, the implication is that, while halflings make comfortable beds and serve a warm meal, they&rsquo;re also pulling illicit money on the side. A halfling&rsquo;s light feet are excellent for thieving, after all, should they feel so inclined. Most Firm communications with the Middle-Managers also leverage gnomish technology, opening the quiet and inaccessible Dead Magic Zones for secret meetings and also blocking most magical forms of tracking. Thus, it is hard to know for sure who hires Contractors and who devises their jobs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A strangely prominent rumor holds that the small Board of Directors which directs the Firm&rsquo;s activities meets aboard a private warship called the Upper Management. Whether or not this rumor holds any truth is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but seeing as the Firm&rsquo;s reach stretches across the &lsquo;verse, into practically every maw station and world on the grid, it&rsquo;s unwise to underestimate their resources.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-firm.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EEOtf022wZ9Z3xi4"},"cf":{"id":"temp_1wcsmr9yxis","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"DdjOFzyRJXlKall5","name":"Chapter 6: Ships - Ship Combat","content":"<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h1>Ship Combat</h1>\n<p>Combat between starships is a deadly and unforgiving game, for the loser is subjected to the lifeless, infinite void of space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship combat follows most of the same rules and conventions as ordinary combat; for example, ships follow an initiative order and generally play on a 2D plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship movement is covered in the Pilot role and ship attacks are covered in the Gunner role. The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order.</p>\n<h2>Character Roles</h2>\n<p>Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a captain, you can use the following actions:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Boarding Party</em></strong>. When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Brace for Impact</em></strong>. You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deep Scan</strong></em>. If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fire at Will</strong></em>. You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Full Speed Ahead</strong></em>. You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Dogfighter</h3>\n<p>You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules<br />as the Pilot&rsquo;s Move action and the Gunner&rsquo;s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot&rsquo;s Dogfighting action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeted Attack</strong></em>. While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship&rsquo;s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship&rsquo;s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship&rsquo;s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship&rsquo;s hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.</p>\n<h3>Engineer</h3>\n<p>As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active.</p>\n<p>The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Directing Power</strong></em>. You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship&rsquo;s engines, the ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship&rsquo;s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields&nbsp;cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 195\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Overcharge</strong></em>. If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship&rsquo;s engines (increasing the ship&rsquo;s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><em><strong>System Repair</strong></em>. You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Void Jump</strong></em>. You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Jump Navigation table when the jump begins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Gunner&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted.</p>\n<p>While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons.</p>\n<p>You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon&rsquo;s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC.</p>\n<p>As a gunner, you can take the following actions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Open Fire</strong></em>. You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Readied Attacks</strong></em>. You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.</p>\n<h3>Pilot</h3>\n<p>As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. Additionally, each ship faces a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions.</p>\n<p>To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a cone of movement, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship&rsquo;s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees.</p>\n<p>As the ship&rsquo;s pilot, you can use the following special actions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Move</strong></em>. You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship&rsquo;s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Evasive Maneuvers</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do&nbsp;so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Dogfighting</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hard Turn</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Match Speed</strong></em>. Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ram</strong></em>. If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature&rsquo;s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.</p>\n<h3>Damage and Repair</h3>\n<p>A ship&rsquo;s hit points are given in mega points and ship- based weapons usually deal damage in mega points as well. Optionally, the GM can rule that non-mega damage can&rsquo;t affect things which have mega hit points, and that mega damage is instantly lethal to non-mega targets.</p>\n<p>When a ship takes hit point damage, it represents structural damage to its hull which is not easily repaired. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship&rsquo;s capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points. Individual systems and weapons, however, can be disabled by precision strikes, which is separate from normal hit point damage.</p>\n<p>Ships are immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shield Points</strong></em>. If a ship has a shield generator, hit<br />point damage might instead be subtracted from the ship&rsquo;s shield points (SP), which are measured in mega hit points. Shields only cover a part of a ship, normally only one side. If the shortest line from an attacker to a shielded ship lands on a shielded side (or a corner of a shielded side), damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather&nbsp;than its hit points. If an attack reduces the shield to 0 shield points, any excess damage carries over to hit points.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A ship with a shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up, at the beginning of the engineer&rsquo;s turn (or the start of the initiative order, if the ship has no engineer).</p>\n<h3>Destruction</h3>\n<p>When a ship drops to 0 hit points, it becomes a blazing wreck. All of its systems, including weapons, engines, and life support, cease to function, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit points. Escape craft, like fighters, life pods, and shuttles can still eject from a blazing wreck. The ship is on a tipping point of complete disaster; it might soon explode outright, or otherwise become a derelict wreck.</p>\n<p>Explosion Saving Throws. If the ship is a blazing wreck at the end of the initiative order, one character makes a unique saving throw, called an explosion saving throw. This saving throw isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score; it is purely dependent on chance.</p>\n<p>Roll a [[/r d20]]. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, the ship becomes a derelict wreck; it is adrift, and all its systems are still disabled, but it is no longer at risk of exploding and can, with extensive efforts, be repaired. On your third failure, the ship explodes, immediately killing any creatures still onboard. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.</p>\n<p>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If your ship takes any damage while it is a blazing wreck, it suffers an explosion saving throw failure.</p>\n<h3>Repair</h3>\n<p>Repairing a ship is a difficult process requiring many hours of work. During your downtime, you can perform repairs on your ship. For each day you spend performing repairs, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. If you have proficiency in ship maintenance tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check, or double your proficiency bonus if you are also proficient with Technology. On a success, the ship regains mega hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, the ship can be repaired completely in one day at port for a fee of 2 gp per mega hit point lost.</p>\n<h3>Boarding</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, your objective in ship-to-ship combat requires that you come aboard a hostile vessel. You can board another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so,&nbsp;any number of crew members or passengers can join a boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat.</p>\n<p>The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus and can only return to their own ship through the umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons.</p>\n<p>If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it.</p>\n<h3>NPC Ships</h3>\n<p>The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen.</p>\n<p>If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn.</p>\n<p>Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions include when one or more player characters has boarded the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship&rsquo;s explosion.</p>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Grid Combat</h3>\n<p>Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.</p>\n<p>When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 198\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Planes of Movement</h3>\n<p>Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many Planes of Movement exist. In open space, there might be three to four, while in orbit around a star, there may only be two.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When moving your ship, you can expend 1,000 feet of movement to move up or down one Plane of Movement (doing so also moves you 500 feet forward in your cone of movement). When you target ships in other planes of movement, they are treated as being an additional 500 feet away for each plane of movement between your ship and the target. Two ships can pass above or below one another in the same space while in different planes of movement.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.oTqHu3oEMVnxJMZ7"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dq06gap2egm","color":"#000000"}}}

It was a struggle just to get the cap off the healing potions, let alone drink them, but Nano ignored the screaming pain signals and pushed through.</p><p>More potions revived Rami and Mekhet-Nu, but all three were still groggy and disoriented when the sound of blaster fire erupted nearby. Dragonborn fighters were descending on all sides, gliding through the low-gravity environment with practiced grace—these were obviously Scale &amp; Fang elites, Garfreckt’s personal bodyguards.</p><p>The three of them forced their aching bodies into action, pushing back the first wave of dragonborn for the price of a haste spell and a salvo of tiny missiles. As they neared the treasure vault, another dragonborn ambusher broke cover to attack.</p><p>“Stand back: this one’s mine!” The wizard leapt up, bowling her target over. He scrabbled for his blaster, but it had already floated nearly ten feet into the air. Eyes fixed on her supine foe, Rami shouted her verbal components, conjuring three massive fists of glowing force. The barrage of strikes slammed home, crushing armor and bone alike.</p><p>Rami led Mekhet-Nu and Nano through a narrow tunnel, cutting off pursuit with a hasty casting of stone shape. At the tunnel’s end, they came to a sealed bulkhead door; the wizard needed only to knock and the passageway opened into Garfreckt’s treasure room.</p><p>Filling most of the asteroid’s internal space, the hoard seemed to shine with auric light. Jewel-encrusted statues and gargantuan paintings lent a smattering of color to the golden backdrop, with countless technological wonders nestled among the piles of coin.</p><p>“There, that’s the <em>Blaster Prototype</em>!” Mekhet\u0002Nu pointed to a pedestal in the center of the room. He set off towards it at a sprint but Garfreckt’s voice flooded into the room.</p><p>“ENOUGH!!” He raged, sending the thieves to the ground by the sheer force of his will. “NONE OF YOU WILL LEAVE HERE ALIVE!!”</p><p>The dragon smashed a claw through the ceiling of the chamber, puncturing the vacuum seal and disrupting whatever spell or device was generating the asteroid’s artificial gravity. Billions of coins scattered in every direction as the air began to rush, howling, out of the room.</p><p>Mekhet-Nu, desperation in his eyes, lunged for the Prototype, propelled by his ki in a colossal leap forward. But as the vacuum outside sized his breath, his limbs turned to lead and his lungs started to burn. Still he drove onwards with another leap: just a little further and the legendary weapon would be within his grasp!</p><p>Feet from his goal, the monk’s vision failed. It was sudden, and incredibly painful. Flailing now for any kind of purchase; any way to drag himself forward; he could feel his time running out. His consciousness starting to fade. A tightness around his chest…</p><p>…And a metallic thump as he hit the deck of a ship? The tightness receded, and Rami stepped away from her comrade. “Man, that was close. You are one lucky duckling, Mek.”</p><p>“My… my eyes… I can’t see. Where are we?”</p><p>“The wizard conjured us a <em>‘Telaros’ terrific transport</em>,’” said Nano’s distinctive voice. “Though we’d never have been able to pick you up without my jetpack. Even managed to snag a few baubles and that gun you were so intent on. All we’ve got to do now is escape from an angry dragon!”</p><p>Mekhet-Nu stiffened as he remembered: “Wait, Nano, I can help with that!”</p><p>Rami’s hands were on his shoulders. “Not now, Mek. What you need to do is rest. We’ll figure something out.”</p><p>“No, it’s my disciples! They’ve got a ship waiting for us, hidden nearby! Get me on the comms so I can send them the code words. Then you’ll only need to evade the dragon until they reach us.”</p><p>Rami and Nano, blindsided by the presence of these unexpected allies, handed the comms to the avia-ra without another word.</p><p>“If it burns, it is a Sun,” he growled. The scanner detected a ship before he had even finished speaking.</p><p>Nano gripped the controls. “Hold tight, you two. It’s time to see just how ‘terrific’ this transport really is…”</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from science; such is arcana of the far future. This chapter contains a number of new spells, many of which, though based on the backbone of classical arcane schools, are intended to be used almost exclusively in space, targeting ships and particularly immense denizens of the Black.</p><p>Spellcasters in Dark Matter have access to their normal class spells, and also add the following additional spells to their spell lists. The remainder of the chapter contains spell descriptions, presented in alphabetical order by the name of the spell.</p><h1>Mega Spells</h1><p>Mega spells possess immense scale and ruinous power, making them ideal for theaters of space combat. However, their construction is fragile, causing them to collapse harmlessly whenever any part of the spell’s effect would intersect with an area of gravity, such as on a planet, moon, or asteroid, or in an area of artificial gravity, such as within a ship. A mega spell can be cast from inside an area of gravity or artificial gravity, as long as its effect lies solely outside the area. These spells are marked with the (mega) tag.</p><p>If a spellcaster that is concentrating on a mega spell is within a ship or a large structure when that object takes damage, the spellcaster must make a concentration check as if they took an amount of damage equal to the number of mega points of damage taken by the object.</p><p>At the GM's discretion, spellcasters with a fixed number of spells known, such as sorcerers and warlocks, can learn one mega spell per spell level, without counting against their total number of spells known.</p><h1>Teleportation</h1><p>Though teleportation magic seems limitless for terrestrial applications, it falls woefully short on a galactic scale. Spells that instantaneously move creatures hundreds of miles, such as teleport, don't penetrate far into the Black. Therefore, any such spell fails if the target location is further than one million miles from its origin. Spells such as gate or plane shift can’t circumvent this limit, either, since leaving and returning to the Material Plane moves very little distance through space.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Spell Lists","type":"text","_id":"C6q3L2kWxASWH05P","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The following spell lists show which spells can be cast by characters of each class.

This class can be found for <strong>free</strong> on <a href=\"https://magehandpress.com/category/content/mage-hand-press-classes/channeler\">magehandpress.com</a></p></div><p>Squalid masses crowd draw close around a young Working furtively with chalk, incense, and an immense tome of diagrams, a bespectacled gnome traces a circle of the floor. With a flick of his wrist, the tile floor vanishes, unveiling a field engulfed in flames and a metallic metallic city looming in the distance.</p><p>A figure clad in a hooded azure robe draws a longsword, hefts it high in one hand, and vanishes. Appearing across the room an instant later, she brings the blade crashing down on a dragon’s head, releasing a hail of blood and sparks.</p><p>Skilled in sword and spell alike, channelers are dynamic and formidable mages who draw their power from the planes of the multiverse. This connection stems from a unique arcane focus, called a portal key, through which they can unlock the doors of the universe.</p><h2>Key Bound</h2><p>The multiverse is crisscrossed by portals, passageways between the planes known only to a select few. Most are completely innocuous—archways, standing stones, ladders, and crawl spaces—until united with a specific magic item, a portal key. At that moment, the portal animates in a dance of arcane energy and twisting spacetime, transporting anyone nearby across the multiverse. These portals and their associated keys are deeply magical, intertwined with the energies of the planes themselves.</p><p>Channelers use these very portal keys as the source of their arcane magic. With one in hand, a channeler can call upon the very tides of the multiverse to fuel their arcana; without one, they have no magic to call their own.</p><h2>Walking the Multiverse</h2><p>Orders of channelers are perhaps the only organizations to possess a comprehensive understanding of the multiverse, its structure, and the portals which weave throughout it. Even the most intrepid explorer will become hopelessly lost among the infinite planes without expert guidance leading them to the right portals. By contrast, a channeler can travel unhindered, using their bound portal key to access a slew of portals known only to them and their order. Most channelers even learn of a few backdoors and side streets between the planes of existence, which they keep secret, in case they ever need to (for example) slip incognito to or from the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p><h2>Swordmages</h2><p>Channelers blur the line between spellcaster and warrior, marrying arcane might with physical prowess. Because all channelers are bound to a portal key, they have the innate potential to focus their spellcasting potential though other objects, and many seek to master the delicate art of balancing a spell’s fury on the edge of a blade. Consequently, their strikes bite not only with steel, but also with flame, lightning, and frost.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"zSIUHz6YCgpsCnHO","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"Class Features","type":"text","_id":"s0pGYE6X3d0ZOHH2","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Quick Build</h2><p>When building a channeler, you need to balance your physical and mental ability scores to maximize your character’s potential. Your highest ability score should be Strength or Dexterity, followed by Intelligence. Your next highest ability score should be Constitution. Then, choose the Order of Blinknights and select the cantrips minor illusion and shocking grasp. Finally, choose any background and a versatile martial weapon as part of your equipment.</p><hr /><p>As a channeler, you have the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>1d10 per channeler level<br /><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level: </strong>10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels: </strong>1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per channeler level after 1st.</p><h3 data-anchor=\"proficiencies\">Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor: </strong>Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor<br /><strong>Weapons: </strong>Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong>Tools:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Saving Throws: </strong>Constitution, Intelligence</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, History, Insight, Investigation, Persuasion, and Religion</p><h3 data-anchor=\"equipment\"><strong>Equipment</strong></h3><div><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p></div><ul><li>A martial weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) any simple melee weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<em>b</em>) a scholar’s pack</li><li>Scale mail and a material component pouch</li></ul><h2><strong>Arcane Reverberation</strong></h2><p>At 1st level, you can sense the reverberations magic leaves inside objects. By spending your action concentrating on an object that you touch, you can make an Intelligence check to determine if the object is under the effect of magic or if it is within the area of any spells (DC equals 10 + the spell’s level). You learn the school of magic, if any. If the object is a magic item, you feel an intense amount of energy, but can’t directly determine the type of item, or its properties. If the object is a portal or a portal key, you know to which plane of existence it leads, and you learn if the portal has any special requirements, but not what these requirements are.</p><h2><strong>Planar Order</strong></h2><p>At 1st level, you align yourself with a close confederation of channelers, called a Planar Order. Your choice is linked to the kind of portal key you wield, for channelers with similar keys might use the same passageways throughout the multiverse. Your choice in planar order grants you features at 1st level, and additional features at 7th, 10th, and 15th level.</p><h3><strong>Portal Key</strong></h3><p>Each order also details the types of portal keys they use to manipulate planar energies and cast spells. With your portal key in hand, you can open certain planar portals (at the GMs discretion) without the normal portal key.<br />If your portal key is out of your reach for longer than 1 minute, you can teleport it back to your hand as a bonus action. If your portal key is ever lost or destroyed, you can replace it by performing a 1-hour ritual, which can be done during a short rest, to imbue an object of a similar type with a portal key’s magic.</p><h2><strong>Fighting Style</strong></h2><p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h3><strong>Combat Casting</strong></h3><p>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls.</p><h3><strong>Dueling</strong></h3><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h3><strong>Hand-and-a-Half</strong></h3><p>While wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h3><strong>Magebreaker</strong></h3><p>When you deal damage to a creature with a melee weapon attack, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by that creature until the beginning of your next turn.</p><h2><strong>Spellcasting</strong></h2><p>Starting at 2nd level, by evoking your connection to the planes through your portal key, you can channel raw power from the multiverse into spells.</p><h3><strong>Arcana Points</strong></h3><p>You have a pool of arcana points, which you can use to cast spells of 1st level and higher. The Arcana Point Cost table summarizes the number of arcana points required to produce a spell slot of 1st to 5th level. Cantrips don’t require spell slots and therefore don’t require arcana points.<br />The Channeler table shows how many arcana points you have and when your point pool increases. You regain all expended arcana points when you finish a long rest.</p><div><h4><strong>Arcana Point Cost</strong></h4></div><table><tbody><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Point Cost</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher</strong></h3><p>You know four first-level spells of your choice from the channeler spell list. The channeler table shows when you learn more channeler spells of your choice. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown on the Max Spell Level column for your level.<br />Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the channeler spells you know and replace it with another spell from the channeler spell list, which also must be of a level no higher than what’s shown on the Max Spell Level column.</p></div><h3><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your channeler spells, since you learn your spells by studying and memorizing sigil sequences to planar gates. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a channeler spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h3><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong></h3><p>You must use your portal key as a spellcasting focus in order to use your channeler spells.</p><h3><strong>Channeler as a Half-Caster</strong></h3><p>Though the channeler class uses arcane points in place of conventional spell slots, this does not exempt it from interacting with multiclassing or other optional rules for spellcasters.<br />Multiclassing, as well as other rules which refer to the Spellcasting feature, treat the Channeler as a Half-Caster, such as a Paladin or Ranger. If the channeler multiclasses with another spellcaster, convert the total number of spell slots of 5th level or lower from the multiclass table into arcana points using the Arcana Point Cost table. Arcana points can only be used to cast spells of 5th level and lower.</p><h2><strong>Spell Channeling</strong></h2><p>By 2nd level, you have mastered the art of channeling spells through your weapon strikes. When you make a spell attack against a creature within your reach while holding a melee weapon that isn’t heavy, you can use your bonus action to substitute the spell attack with a melee weapon attack. On a hit, the weapon attack deals normal damage, in addition to the effects of the spell.</p><h2><strong>Planar Focus</strong></h2><p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can narrow your focus to channel energy from a particular part of the multiverse. You can use your bonus action to begin or end a planar focus. Once on each of your turns, you can switch your active focus. You maintain this effect as if concentrating on a spell.</p><p>You have the following four focus options:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Elemental Air.</strong></em> Your movement speed increases by 10 feet, you can stand from being prone without using any movement, and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Elemental Earth.</strong></em> While you are not holding a shield, your Armor Class increases by 2.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Elemental Fire.</strong></em> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a channeler spell, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Elemental Water.</strong></em> Whenever you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage and you do not have resistance to that type of damage, you can use your reaction to halve the damage taken.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Ability Score Improvement</strong></h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2><strong>Extra Attack</strong></h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h2><strong>Combat Channeling</strong></h2><p>Starting at 5th level, when you use Spell Channeling, you can make two melee weapon attacks, instead of one. The second attack must target a different creature than the first. The effects of the spell are only triggered on the first hit.<br />At 11th level, both melee weapon attacks can target the same creature.</p><h2><strong>Null Arcane</strong></h2><p>At 6th level, you have learned to tap into the Void between planes. When you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell of 5th level or lower, you can use your reaction to produce a field of opposing magic, nullifying the effect. You expend a number of arcana points equal to the spell’s point cost, as shown in the Arcana Point Cost table (or 1 point for a cantrip) and make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.</p><h2><strong>Greater Focus</strong></h2><p>Starting at 14th level, you gain the following Planar Focus options:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Limbo.</strong></em> Once per turn when you deal damage to a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action to sap some arcane energy from the strike. On a hit, you regain 1 arcana point, up to your arcana point maximum.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Paradise.</strong></em> You have a flight speed equal to your movement speed. When you begin your turn in the air, you can maintain this effect by spending an arcana point. Otherwise, you fall.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Underworld.</strong></em> You can cast the spell <em>vampiric touch</em> without using arcana points. You maintain concentration on this spell as long as you maintain this planar focus.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Planeshifter</strong></h2><p>Starting at 18th level, you can freely walk the planes. You can cast the <em>plane shift</em> spell once, without using arcana points or spell components.<br />Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before using it again.</p><h3><strong>Nexus Arcane</strong></h3><p>At 20th level, you connect with the central nexus of all existence. When you roll initiative and have no arcana points remaining, you immediately regain 10 arcana points.</p><h1>PLANAR ORDERS</h1><p>A channeler’s first steps into the multiverse are daunting: the infinite planes of existence are treacherous and do not yield their secrets easily. To this end, channelers abroad in the multiverse rely on their planar orders for guidance, protection, and information.

How did you acquire your key, and to which portal was it originally bound? If your key is a weapon, is it a family heirloom, a trophy taken from victorious combat, or a rusted piece of junk?

While holding your mawstone, you can use the following psionic abilities:<br />     <em><strong>Empathy. </strong></em>You can use your action to probe the surface level of a creature's emotions. You must be able to see the  creature and it must be within 30 feet and have an Intelligence of 3 or higher.

The book begins inscribed with two 1st-level spells of your choice that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list. Spells copied into this spellbook don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your spellbook in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means.

Your battlefists have the Light property while you wield them.</p><p>When you use the Attack action to attack with a battlefist, you can make one attack with another one you are wielding as a bonus action.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>At 1st level, you learn three cantrips of your choice from the following list: chill touch, light, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, produce flame, resistance, shocking grasp, and true strike.</p><h3>Bonus Focus</h3><p>At 7th level, you gain the following Planar Focus option:</p><p><em><strong>Olympus</strong></em>. While in this concentration, you grow to titanic size, as per the Enlarge effect of the enlarge/ reduce spell.</p><h3>Concussive Strike</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can knock people into a daze. Whenever you hit with one of your battlefists, you can spend 2 arcana points to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is dazed until the end of its next turn. A dazed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Any creature that is immune to being stunned is also immune to being dazed.</p><h3>Meteor Blow</h3><p>At 15th level, when you make an attack with one of your battlefists on your turn, you can channel your might into a single colossal strike. On a hit, this attack deals an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, if the target is on the ground, each creature on the ground other than yourself within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half this amount and is not knocked prone.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Channeler Spells","type":"text","_id":"CsUC91JozYOUDN9N","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Masters of planar arcana and keepers of dimensional secrets, channelers possess a handful of unique spells not known to other spellcasters.

Operating at least one bar/inn/business office on every maw on the grid (including those on the outer rim), GGFC is often seen as one of the more stable sources of income a decent, hardworking adventurer can come across, so long as they don’t mind the fifteen percent finder’s fee (and the smell).    Established over fifty years ago, Grax’s Guys for Cheap is the lifetime project of Grax Grraxe, an orcish warlord who left the Warzone to escape the constant bloodshed, explosions, and general unpleasantness. Finding that he couldn't obtain decent work on any planet he visited (at least, work that didn’t involve clubbing someone in the knees), Grax moved to the outer ring, sold his ship, and set about establishing a company that would accept anyone as a patron or employee. Today, no other mercenary service in the ‘verse is as widespread. While others may have nicer equipment, have better training, or fly around in nicer ships, none can match Grax’s Guys for sheer numbers or tenacity; also, Grax serves the best beer.</p>\n<div><img style=\"float:left\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/graxs-club-logo.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></div>\n<p>   GGFC operates somewhat differently to most other mercenary companies. While they aren't averse to the usual bodyguard duty, security detail, or military backup that most mercs expect, prospective employers can ask almost anything of Grax’s Guys: a given merc might take a job shipping Rosvalian star pigs across the galaxy, only to then act as a short order cook in the restaurant those pigs are served at. This wide net of job postings has been a cornerstone of Grax’s success. Grax’s Guys will take nearly any job, provided that it is both legal in most galactic territories and the pay is acceptable, with a halfup- front deposit. Their tagline “You can trust Grax!” can be seen advertised in almost every port in the ‘verse.</p>\n<p>   Since its inception, Grax has made a point to offer regular contracts to mercs from disenfranchised and distrusted races, particularly half-breeds. His experience attempting to find gainful employment after departing the Warzone keyed him in to the need for reliable and legal employment for the galaxy’s outcasts. Not to mention the fact that half-orcs are tough and easy to hire.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/graxs-guys.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"gm-notes":{},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.obt0UclEHb8Y3HGJ"},"cf":{"id":"temp_1wcsmr9yxis","color":"#000000"}}}

How did you escape?” someone asked.</p><p>“Look, I don’t want to say I outsmarted an eternal dragon…” she paused. “But he should have known I’d have a few scrolls handy. A <em>terrific transport</em> was perfect to get everyone together and out of the vacuum.”</p><p>“Okay, but how did you get away from the asteroid?” Came the immediate response. “Your shuttle wouldn’t have lasted six seconds against the dragon.”</p><p>“You can thank him for that,” she pointed at Mekhet-Nu, seated at the other end of the bar. “Turns out he’d got in touch with some of his disciples ahead of time. They had a ship waiting for us right when we needed it.”</p><p>The crowd went quiet for a while. In a low voice, someone remarked: “strange choice for a partner in crime.”</p><p>“Hey, don’t you be sneering at Mek. He’s alright, for an avia-ra.” She waved at him across the bar.</p><p>It was still hard to read the monk’s expressions, even after spending so much time with him. Rami thought he was smiling, but he didn’t wave back.</p><p>‒ ‒ ‒</p><p>Mekhet-Nu dived out of the way as the Blaster Prototype unleashed another unstable wave of energy.</p><p>“I did not expect such petulant behavior!” The weapon, of course, said nothing. It was in one of its sulky moods today. Mekhet-Nu adopted a parental tone.</p><p>“Young miss, are you not the legendary Prototype, first of all blasters?” The weapon’s arcane engine revved, emitting bright blue exhaust from two ports like piercing eyes.</p><p>“Do you not possess terrific power?” Again, the weapon unleashed a wild torrent of fire, this time scorching a training dummy to ash.</p><p>“Then why won’t you <em>yield</em>?” said the avia-ra, aggravation cracking his usual stony demeanor. Defiant, the blaster belched forth a wave of exhaust gas.</p><p>Mekhet-Nu took a deep breath to center himself. The <em>Blaster Prototype</em> was not only alive, but downright tempestuous. Yet he had patience in droves. More importantly, he had no other options. When the High Priests of the Sun came for him, he and the <em>Prototype</em> would have to be ready.</p><p>‒ ‒ ‒</p><p>“Almost… there…” Nano groaned, leveraging the wrenchinator with all possible weight. As the bolt gave way, the entire chassis clunked into place and circuits sprung to life. Dragon’s fire rushed outward from the breastplate, ejecting spouts of flame at every bolt and joint. As the flames reached the golem’s extremities, its hands clenched and its head turned to see its creator.</p><p>Nano was surprised that the trinket stolen from the dragon’s hoard even fit, but dumbfounded to see it working. After all, the inside of the golem was now more vent tape than circuitry.</p><p>“Welcome to the ‘verse, Mac!” Nano knocked once on the golem’s chest to hear the satisfying clunk. This was the gadget to end all gadgets! Should probably build some legs for it, though.</p><p>‒ ‒ ‒</p><p>Garfreckt, the eternal dragon, touched down on Sepa-Atef, blasting a massive cloud of sand out into the desert. In the distance, he could see mountains, some of them towering to two or three times his own height.</p><p>The avia-ra delegation came buzzing over the jagged horizon in their Herald- and Pilgrim\u0002class ships, golden livery glinting in the light from this planet’s twin stars.</p><p>Garfreckt signaled his lieutenants to welcome the High Priests of the Sun. “Greetings, your eminences. The eternal dragon is greatly pleased to meet you face-to-face.”</p><p>“The pleasure is all ours,” gushed the priests’ interpreter, bowing deeply, “and we are most eager to do business with such a great and esteemed partner. Especially considering the… intelligence that you have recently acquired.”</p><p>As the priests took their thrones, a Scale & Fang wizard conjured an illusory image of Mekhet-Nu. “We understand that you are seeking this man. What would you give to know where he is hiding, I wonder…?”</p></blockquote><hr><p>These appendices will explore the ‘verse in detail, (mostly using expansive tables) to give GMs and players a more concrete idea of how to run adventures in Dark Matter.</p><p><strong>@UUID[.m3pK3Fqw8THA4Sye]{Appendix A}</strong> provides GMs with an invaluable series of tables to quickly create new planets with their own unique hooks, quirks, and names.

Of that staggering number, only a handful are remotely habitable for most intelligent life, and an even smaller fraction are picturesque worlds suitable for cultivation. To aid explorers and colonists sorting through the databases of categorized worlds, most spacing guilds use the following universal tier system, based on a planet’s habitability:</p><p><em>Tier 1:</em> <em><strong>Golden Worlds</strong></em>. Terrestrial planets capable of self-sustaining animal and humanoid life, for greater than 10 million residents.</p><p><em>Tier 2:</em> <em><strong>Garden Worlds</strong></em>. Terrestrial planets capable of self-sustaining animal and humanoid life, up to a maximum of 10 million residents.</p><p><em>Tier 3:</em> <em><strong>Colony Worlds</strong></em>. Terrestrial planets with moderately hostile environments (such as thin or volatile atmospheres, extreme high/low temperatures, minimal dry land coverage, etc.) Potentially habitable, but require specialized equipment and/or protective magic.</p><p><em>Tier 4:</em> <em><strong>Dead Worlds</strong></em>. Terrestrial planets with extremely hostile environments (such as a toxic or corrosive atmosphere, or extreme volcanic activity). Uninhabitable even with specialized equipment/long term protective magics.</p><p><em>Tier 5:</em> <em><strong>Gas Giants</strong></em>. Due to their incredible mass, these planets are uninhabitable, apart from floating or orbiting outposts.</p><p><em>Tier X:</em> <em><strong>Anomaly</strong></em>. Addendum tier which denotes planets (terrestrial or gaseous) with extreme or bizarre topographical or constructive traits. For example, a Garden World that also contains floating mountains would be classified as a Tier 2X world.</p><p>You can determine the properties of a planet quickly by rolling on the following tables. Choose an option or roll a d6 to determine a planet’s Tier, a d12 on the corresponding table to determine that planet’s characteristics, and a d100 to determine its name.

Melding words from some languages with technical jargon, brand names, and copious amounts of slang, spacer lingo can seem like a language all its own. <br />    This appendix contains a selection of words and phrases spacers regularly use:</p><p><strong>Aughtime:</strong> (n) From “aught time,” this regulated 24-hour time zone is synchronized with times on High Terra. Since human shipping lanes have become prevalent, most spacers (human and otherwise) now synchronize to aughtime on long travels. Ex: “You lost six hours since taking off. Set your clock to aughtime and take a nap.”</p><p><strong>Bugging Out/Roach Raging: </strong>(v) A term for the maniacal symptoms caused by withdrawal from Ocoulori Radavitis. Ex: “He's totally bugging out.”, “Suspect appears to be roach raging, advise caution.”</p><p><strong>Broker: </strong>(n) Not to be confused with a Soul Broker, one who works with the Cabal and trades souls, a broker is an individual who collects secrets and trades information for money. Brokers are known as a surefire way of learning tidbits on important or elusive topics, but are exorbitantly expensive, associate with shady characters, and are always accompanied by burly hired thugs. Ex: “Trail’s gone cold. No option now: we’ve got to see the broker.”</p><p><strong>Comma (or CommA): </strong>(n) A booming genre of electronic music popularized by comm sets capable of automatically generating original streams of this music. The name originates from the setting used to generate it: “Play: Comm: A,” which gradually became “Comm A,” and then “CommA.” Ex: “Grooving down to some comma? Kids these days don't know the classics!”</p><p><strong>Going Dark: </strong>(v) A phrase meaning to engage a void jump using a Dark Matter engine, likely originating from the closing of metal shutters and dimming of lights during jumps. Ex: “Going dark in three minutes, buckle up.”</p><p><strong>Hopper: </strong>(n) A ship with at most a Class 1 or 2 Dark Matter engine, so called because it is only good for hopping between planets within one system. Ex: “The dealer was only selling hoppers; nothing that'd get us to the Citadel and back.”</p><p><strong>Krash: </strong>(n) A popular brand of canned fizzy drink, so enjoyed by spacers that it has become a generic term for soft drinks in general. Its biggest competitor, Orc-a-Cola, sells fewer than half the number of drinks KrashCorp. does in a given year. Ex: “While you’re out, could you grab some Krash?” “Sure, Krash Zero, Tropi\u0002Krash, or Orc-a-Cola?”</p><p><strong>Locals: </strong>(n) Native inhabitants of a world which have not encountered space travelers before. Ex: “Head back to the shuttle; keep your blasters ready, but mind the locals.”</p><p><strong>Marbles: </strong>(n) The small, bland, pellets dispensed by most cheap shipboard meal fabricators. Though nutritious, they're far from desirable. Ex: “I’d kill for a nice steak. Or even a bad steak. Anything that isn’t marbles.”</p><p><strong>Meeb: </strong>(n) Slang for amoeboid.</p><p><strong>Murmurs: </strong>(n) Distant, indistinct voices heard among the static between stations on basically all communication devices, from huge etheradio stations to personal comm sets. No consensus explanation exists for this phenomenon, but some believe they can understand the murmurs. Ex: “Sometimes, when I go to sleep, I put on the murmurs to relax.”</p><p><strong>Praise the Sun: </strong>(v) While rude to utter while in avia-ra company, this refers to the single-minded pursuit of an unusual line of thought or course of action. In other words, insanity. Ex: “Why would he do something so odd?” “He's praising the sun.”</p><p><strong>The Pins: </strong>(n) The nauseous disorientation caused by being compressed into the space of an atom for a fraction of a millisecond, which spacers feel shortly after conducting a void jump. With time, veteran spacers grow accustomed to the pins, but new-timers almost always vomit. “Guh, I never get used to the pins. I’ll need something to settle my stomach.”</p><p><strong>Seven O' Seven: </strong>(n) A very good deal, which one would be a fool to refuse. This phrase is in reference to Unit 707, the vect commander which offered aid to the nearly defeated elven armada during the Night Crusade. Ex: “The Firm gave him a seven o' seven: skip town or see the business end of a repeater.”</p><p><strong>Slag: </strong>(v) Originally a reference to the molten debris left behind when a ship is destroyed with lasers, this phrase has become synonymous with “kill” or “destroy.” Ex: “Do you wanna get slagged?”</p><p><strong>Solaris Vult: </strong>An avia-ra war cry, a mantra repeated during holy Crusades. Ex: “Solaris Vult! Solaris VULT! SOLARIS VULT!”</p><p><strong>Space Madness: </strong>(n) A joke often played on first-time spacers normally involving one or more persons pretending to become infected with said \"madness\". Ex: “Look out! He's got the Space Madness!”</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Appendix D: Useful Facts  and Conversions","type":"text","_id":"jlU1VDM66RIM8pgv","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Depending on the type of campaign that you run using this book, you might use frequent calculations as you navigate through space.

With the right gear, the right ship, and the right crew, you’re almost guaranteed to make it from your initial port of call to wherever you’re heading, barring some unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>  That said, below are listed a number of potential hazards that could adversely affect your ability to get around the ‘verse:</p><h2>Dead Magic Zone</h2><p>Where the edges of space wear thin, the fabric of magic has torn, leaving immense Dead Magic Zones in space where no arcana can exist. These regions behave much like antimagic zones and influence magical technology in the same way as magic items. Additionally, constructs within the zones are paralyzed, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</p><p>  Vect, as living constructs, are not fully disabled within a Dead Magic Zone, but develop stutters in their voices and movement, and gain a level of exhaustion which can’t be removed while they remain in the zone.</p><p>  Ships can no longer move, and all their systems and weapons are fully disabled. Thankfully, even void crystals fall inert, or the resulting shutdown of the ship’s Dark Matter engine would be catastrophic. Gnomish technology, which is built on scientific principles, can operate normally in Dead Magic Zones.</p><h2>Extreme Temperature</h2><p>Few places in the galaxy are a comfortable temperature for organic life. The Black is an endless icy nothingness, whereas stars are universally scorching hellscapes; the friendly bands between these extremes, where organic life can comfortably exist, are few and far-between. Very hot and very cold terrestrial temperatures generally call for creatures to make Constitution saving throws (the DC varying based upon the temperature) to avoid exhaustion and other hazards, such as frostbite and sunburns. However, extreme temperatures, such as those found in space, are immediately life threatening.</p><p>  At the beginning of its turn, an unprotected creature exposed to extreme cold or extreme heat takes 1d6 cold or fire damage, respectively. If still exposed at the beginning of its next turn, the creature takes 2d6 damage, and 3d6 damage at the beginning of the turn following that, and so on, up to a maximum of 10d6. Even more extreme temperatures will begin damage with a higher number of damage dice, at the GM's discretion.</p><h2>N-Virus</h2><p>The N-Virus is a magical disease which affects only constructs and can lay dormant in machines for some time. Living constructs, such as vect and android characters, are particularly vulnerable, as the virus completely overwrites their personalities as it runs its course.</p><p>  If a construct comes in physical contact with a construct infected with the virus or uses an arcane terminal or other device infected with it, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Symptoms are minor at first, consisting of malfunctions and instances of faulty logic, but as the virus moves to dominate the construct's core, the virus reveals its true nature. The virus intelligently delays its progression, lying dormant for up to 30 days, until more constructs are infected or the infected construct has escaped quarantine.</p><p>  A construct with the N-Virus develops a fiendish intelligence and the sinister obsession of spreading the virus further. The construct's Intelligence score becomes 16 if it were lower. An infected character’s alignment becomes chaotic evil, and it gains the following ideal: “I will spread the N-Virus at all costs.” The GM can take control of the character until the virus is removed. Additionally, an infected construct gains the ability to instill faults within machines, gaining the following trait:</p><p>  <em><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong></em>. The infected construct’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Intelligence modifier). The construct can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p><p>  At will:<em> @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.spells.R3cFURZ3FfWFapjM]{Technomancy}<br /></em>  3/day each: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.spells.DiDfppTEqLbn7CD2]{Circuit Breaker}, @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.spells.1qTPdWFLqplwma1o]{Perception Hack}, @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.spells.DeRlJagpwaBLDKWd]{Technical Difficulties}<br /></em></p><p>  The N-Virus can be prevented with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.spells.DPu0d6VmHInIX5dt]{Antivirus} </em>spell. It can be cured with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}</em> spell while it lays dormant, but once it progresses, it can only be cured with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} </em>spell, or similar magic, or if the character is killed and returned to life.</p><h2>Radiation</h2><p>Even brief exposure to hazardous radiation can kill, as evidenced by the bursts of radiant energy produced by blasters, but prolonged exposure can be just as deadly. A creature that spends one minute exposed to radiation must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one hour. While poisoned, the creature's hit point maximum is decreased by 5. Each subsequent failed saving throw against radiation while the creature is poisoned increases the duration the creature is poisoned by an additional hour and decreases its hit point maximum by an additional 5. If a creature’s hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies.</p><p>  Lastly, when a creature that has been poisoned due to radiation recovers from being poisoned, roll a d20. On a 1, the creature suffers a severe side effect from the poisoning: an aneurysm or a cancerous growth. The creature's hit point maximum is halved until it is healed by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} </em>spell or similar magic.</p><h2>Roach Addiction</h2><p>Long term consumption of <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.2MLjtNLyjOuc0M1q]{roaches (Ocoulori Radavitis)}</strong>, is addictive and dangerous. Roaches are sentient and psychic creatures, and their violent deaths gradually wear down the psyche of those who eat them. When a creature consumes a roach, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes addicted and gains one randomly-determined @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables.MAL5r8ZKx7BVsE9R]{Indefinite Madness} trait. While addicted, it gains a level of exhaustion whenever it goes longer than 7 days without consuming a roach. Each time it fails this Wisdom save, it gains an additional Indefinite Madness trait and the time before exhaustion sets in decreases by 1 day, to a minimum of 1 day. Addiction can be ended by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse}</em> spell and its lingering madness traits can be cured by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration}</em> spell or similar magic.</p><h2>Vacuum</h2><p>The vacuum of space is the apex of hazards; its extreme temperature and complete absence of air are universally lethal. No creature can hold its breath in a vacuum. Upon entering a vacuum without a breathing apparatus, a creature can survive a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 2 rounds). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hits points and is dying.</p><p>  A creature with a breathing apparatus might still be subject to Extreme Temperature if it doesn't have other protective equipment.</p><p>  Casting a spell with a verbal component is impossible in a vacuum.</p><h2>Variable Gravity</h2><p>Though it’s natural to take gravitational forces for granted while on a planet or within a ship with artificial gravity, the ‘verse abounds with different gravitational environments, each of which pose a unique challenge to spacers and explorers.</p><p>  <em>Zero Gravity</em>. Whenever a ship loses its life support system while in the Black or someone decides to go on a spacewalk, they experience zero gravity. In zero gravity environments, creatures and objects hang in the air until they are moved. A creature in zero gravity can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. Its speed is otherwise reduced to zero. Once a creature or object is set into motion, it can’t stop moving until it collides with an obstacle. A creature automatically continues its movement at the same speed at the beginning of its turn, and an object set in motion moves with the same speed each round after it was moved.</p><p>  Creatures and objects in an area of zero gravity have no weight, but still may require some strength to push.</p><p><em>  Low Gravity</em>. Planetoids, asteroids, and moons with any sort of gravity will have low gravity, which only tenuously draws objects to the surface after allowing them to linger in the air for some time.</p><p>  In low gravity, the weight of all creatures and objects is halved. A creature in low gravity can jump twice the normal height and distance. Additionally, a creature takes half damage from falling in low gravity.</p><p>  <em>High Gravity</em>. High gravity conditions are common in the ‘verse, as it is the default environment for large and dense planets, though it also occurs whenever a ship strays too close to a massive object, such as a star or a black hole.</p><p>  Each creature in an area of high gravity area must spend two feet of movement for every foot moved, including flying, jumping, and climbing movement. This can be combined with difficult terrain to slow movement to a quarter of normal speed. If a prone creature wishes to stand up, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check. On a failure, it can’t move at all on its turn.</p><p>  Objects in the area, including those being worn or carried, weigh double their usual weight, which therefore may cause creatures to become encumbered or cause load bearing spells like levitate to fail. Creatures and objects take double damage from falling.</p><p>  <em>Extreme Gravity</em>. While high gravity can be tolerated for some time, extreme gravity is outright lethal. Extreme gravity carries all the penalties of high gravity, but a creature makes all Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws with disadvantage. Additionally, at the beginning of its turn, a creature in extreme gravity takes bludgeoning damage based on its size: a Small creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage, a Medium creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, a Large creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, a Huge creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage, and a Gargantuan creature takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage.</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.UGVhrrsKY7b5PhTD"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bjgntohdazs"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668640417319,"modifiedTime":1670528572893,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"KIk8unhUKSdtoAki"}

{"_id":"NcRFa8BApc57zJFm","name":"Faction - The Coalition","content":"<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-coalition.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"135\" /></div>\n<p>Based on the militarized world of Fraxus-12 on the outer rim, the Coalition is the largest private military corporation in the &lsquo;verse. Established five hundred years ago by a group of defected military leaders, the Coalition purportedly maintains a standing army of nearly a billion soldiers, with an armada to match. While these numbers pale in comparison to the military might of the elves, dwarves, or humans, Coalition soldiers are exceptionally well-trained and equipped, making them more than a match for any combatant. Though Coalition soldiers can be hired as bodyguards or mercenaries, the Coalition&rsquo;s specialty is turning the tide of galactic conflict (for the right price).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Coalition is led by a council of generals, admirals, and sky marshals called the War Room. This council of military experts debates tactics, establishes new military doctrine, and even deliberates on changes to the Coalition soldier&rsquo;s basic uniform. The War Room is presided over by the current High Lord Marshal, Tiberious Vinter, an imposing half-orc with nearly a century of combat experience and a prodigiously impressive beard. In the War Room, the High Lord Marshal&rsquo;s word is law and his decisions are final; and to his credit, Marshal Vinter rarely makes decisions rashly or without deliberation. He and his council are all too aware that their actions carry the weight of millions of lives, which none of them take lightly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Though the Coalition will join any war effort which can afford their services, all of its soldiers abide by a strict code of warfare. This code prohibits slavery, genocide, planetary destruction (excluding Tier 4 and 5 worlds), and out-and-out piracy. Any soldier or officer found to be engaging in such activity will be immediately censured and subjected to military tribunal. As such, even though the Coalition operates in the same theater as other mercenary groups, such as Grax&rsquo;s Guys and Scale and Fang, they are treated with a measure of respect that elevates them from the competition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to its incredible armada, the Coalition&rsquo;s greatest asset might be its chapter of warmages. During the Rift War of humanity, the old Warmage College was split between fighting the Elven Forest-Fleet for the Alliance or fighting the Orcish Warhorde with Lakshay. When the dust settled, Lakshay separated from the Alliance and the College of Warmages pledged their devotion to the new government of Lakshay. Warmage loyalists were appalled, and many defected to join the Coalition, a force they saw as a neutral camp between the alliances of humanity. Today, the Coalition employs its warmages as a cutting-edge force of arcane troops, blending combative magic with new technology, giving Coalition forces an unparalleled tactical advantage on the field of battle.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-coalition.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.d7i1fGiDaXrMCMyy"},"cf":{"id":"temp_1wcsmr9yxis","color":"#000000"}}}

All that remained was to plant the distraction, sneak into the treasure cave, and make a clean getaway.</p><p>It did not take long at all for things to go awry. Mere seconds after their arrival in Garfreckt’s asteroid field, the dragon appeared on the sensor screens, an ominous rendering of wings and horns perched atop an asteroid, and a fearsome growl filled the vacuum of space.</p><p>“You fools think to rob me? Ha! Preposterous! I am Garfreckt, the Eternal Dragon!! And I can smell your humanoid stink from light years away.”</p><p>Rami let out a long stream of curses before Nano opened a telepathic channel on the ship’s communicator. “Let’s not be hasty here, 'o mighty dragon. We come bearing gifts… Hey Mek, arm one of the arcane warheads.”</p><p>The avia-ra took a second to understand the intent behind Nano’s improvisation. “No longer a distraction, then, but a bluff?” He asked once the channel had closed. “It won’t work. Look, he’s drawing closer.”</p><p>“Let’s show him we mean business. Even an eternal dragon’s got to think twice after taking a hit from one of these.”</p><p>Mekhet-Nu composed himself. “To fire such a weapon… it is a weighty thing, even if there’s no one nearby to be caught in the blast. At least allow me a moment to reflect.” The monk paused for several seconds, exhaled, then pressed the button.</p><p>Nano and Mekhet-Nu sat on a silent bridge for what seemed like an eternity. They looked at each other, expressions blank. Both were starting to reach for their controls when the shockwave hit; the massive discharge of energy making waves in the very fabric of reality. Hurled from their seats, they were surprised to find themselves floating up to the ceiling, the artificial gravity temporarily disabled.</p><p>Mekhet-Nu reacted fastest, whirling around in mid-air and catapulting himself off the ceiling and back to his station. “Rami!” He barked into the intercom. “Damage report! The life support seems to be down!”</p><p>“On it,” she replied. “Uh, this might take a while. Try not to breathe too much…”</p><p>“Can do!” Nano chirped, now back in the captain’s chair. The next message went out to Garfreckt: “So how do you like that, dragon? We’ve got plenty more where that came from!”</p><p>A furious hissing was the only response, as the thieves watched Garfreckt retreat behind an asteroid for cover.</p><p>For the next few minutes, the pair on the bridge said nothing, carefully piloting the ship towards the dragon’s hoard, hoping both that their deception would hold and Rami would be able to repair the damaged systems with equal fervor.</p><p>As they closed on their goal, Rami appeared on the bridge, filthy and reeking of ozone. “I’ve done all I can. Fabricator and arcane cannon are fried. Life support is busted too, but I’ve managed to rig the air filter up so we won’t suffocate. At least, for a while. Also, while I was down there, I noticed that the antivirus module on the computer seems to be overheating… What do you reckon that’s all about, Nano?”</p><p>The vect froze for a second, then leapt down the corridor to engineering, nearly bowling Rami over on the way through. “You have the bridge, Mek!”</p><p>Nano’s anguished scream could be heard even without the intercom. “Mek, double-check the sensors! I think Garfreckt’s figured out—”</p><p>“—THAT YOU FOOLS THINK I WOULD FALL FOR SUCH A CHEAP TRICK!” This time, Garfreckt’s voice was transmitted over the ship’s internal comms. “I suggest you brace for impact,” he growled, voice dripping with cold fury.</p><p>Rami, Nano, and Mekhet-Nu were given no time at all to enact that order, as a massive claw crashed into their ship that very instant. The whole craft groaned under the impact; walls and floors bending and flexing as the superstructure twisted and buckled. The crew were tossed around viciously, with Rami blacking out due to the extreme forces.</p><p>Mekhet-Nu was the next to fall, engulfed in searing light as the ship crashed into an asteroid. The last thing he saw was Nano, fiddling with yet another gadget.</p></blockquote><h1>The monsters of Dark Matter…</h1><p>…are alien by definition; most hail from planets that humans have never set foot upon, and range from the impossibly strange, like psionic psi\u0002worm gestalts, to unthinkably gigantic Mega creatures, such as god-aboleths or the eternal dragons. Whatever form they take, the monsters of Dark Matter remind us of the simple truth that the universe is hostile, and explorers have plenty to fear.</p><p>This chapter includes a large selection of monsters that can be encountered throughout the verse, followed by a selection of NPCs that might be used to populate your maws, hearthstations, and crews.</p><h1>New Monster Traits</h1><p>The constructs and alien beasts found on expeditions to the farthest reaches of space have unique traits never seen in terrestrial creatures.</p><h2>New Size Category: Mega</h2><p><em>Dark Matter</em> introduces a new size category, larger even than Gargantuan: Mega. Creatures of Mega size will always have the Mega Creature trait, which will elaborate on its dimensions. Some Mega creatures occupy a 500-by\u0002500-foot space (only one square using the Rule of 100), while others can be as large as a 2000-by-2000-foot space. Generally, Mega creatures will possess mega hit points, deal mega damage, and will have movement and senses reaching thousands of feet, to match their scale.</p><p>Mega creatures can't be summoned, and non-mega creatures can't transform into them.</p><p>Slaying one of these creatures is no task for terrestrial adventurers; they are best combated using ships, tanks, and warheads. Even the smallest Mega creatures can pose a profound threat to entire worlds.</p><h2>New Sense: Thermalsight</h2><p>A monster with thermalsight can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog. The monster can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, the monster can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. Many constructs have this special sense.</p><h2>Variant Familiars</h2><p>The find familiar spell provides a comfortable number of options to arcanists, but many spellcasters are eager to summon more exotic companions with the spell. With the GM's permission, a spellcaster can summon any of the following monsters as a familiar: a mechanical spider, a psi-worm, a software bug, a thwirrel, or a

src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch07-wizmos-n-dog.webp\" alt width=\"300\" /><p>The 'verse is home to such a variety of life that much of it defies classification. Though many types of alien creatures appear to share throughlines in shape and function, they are outnumbered by the remarkable and utterly unique creatures found on nearly every world. Each habitable world demands unique adaptations, and through complex chains of evolution, sometimes assisted by magic, they can become inhabited by truly bizarre creatures.</p><p>As completely alien as these creatures might seem, they are no more than ordinary beasts on their homeworlds; by contrast, monstrosities and aberrations lie outside this natural framework altogether.</p><p><em><strong>Boundless Biodiversity</strong></em>. No matter how strange an alien beast might be, adventurers and explorers are likely to refer to them by analogy to things they understand. Descriptions like \"an alligator with a giraffe's neck and a whale's body\" are not uncommon. For some alien beasts, these analogies aren't far off; some appear merely like discolored or missized versions of familiar animals. Others, however, are far more exotic. It's difficult to describe the floating ooze-fungus beasts of Nix, for example, without mentioning how their three long legs resemble the arms of a praying mantis, but translucent and many times their size.</p><h2>Alien Beast Template</h2><p>The animals and plants of distant worlds are much like terrestrial creatures and retain the same statistics, except as noted below:</p><p><em><strong>Resistances</strong></em>.

The vast majority, however, act out their parts as sociable constructs, mimicking humanoid behaviors to look more convincingly alive. To most, this charade is amazingly realistic, but under the surface, androids are still nothing more than sophisticated circuitry hooked up to a humming construct core.</p><p><em><strong>Replicant Servitors</strong></em>. Conventional automatons excel at menial tasks, and can be programmed to perform a wide variety of labors, but simply can't connect to humanoids on a social level. Androids, by contrast, were designed to fill exactly that role.</p><p>Hegemony engineers pioneered android technology in an effort to boost human expansion. An android's human\u0002like skin conceals a powerful robotic frame underneath, capable of lifting many times its own weight. Were it not for hard-coded instructions to limit this strength, an android could easily crush its human masters. This incredible might, along with their ability to survive in a total vacuum, makes them ideal for long-term exploration and colonization missions.</p><p><em><strong>Version 13</strong></em>. Early models of androids suffered from an extremely unnerving resemblance to humanoids, but later models made vast strides in approximating convincing humanoid appearance and behavior. By Version 10, androids were perfectly convincing in controlled circumstances. Versions 11 and 12 expanded their versatility and implemented rigorous learning systems to better copy the intelligence of living humanoids. Version 13 was a disaster.</p><p>Millions of Version 13 androids were made and shipped around the galaxy, but within the year, it was clear something was wrong with the model. Some androids malfunctioned, while others escaped their masters and vanished completely. Many Version 13 androids began to suspect they were actually alive, and learned to deactivate their fail-safes, as well as the fail-safes of other constructs. After a series of android-perpetuated murders on High Terra, things reached a fever pitch, and the entire line was to be \"recalled\"—that is, destroyed and sold for scrap.</p><p>Thousands of Version 13 androids escaped destruction, and remain at large to this day, blending in perfectly with humanoids societies around the galaxy. These androids are functionally immortal, unlike newer android models, but are constantly hunted by Hegemony authorities, seeking to correct the mistake. Newer versions of androids sometimes also go rogue and escape detection for some time, but newer safety measures, along with an enforced lifespan, have kept them from becoming as prolific and singularly dangerous as the Version 13s.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. An android doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Artificial Intelligences</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.EY3J0m8u7V7eYZOP]{Rogue AI} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.yw68mHai7UfFEtE8]{Mastermind AI}</p><p>Sophisticated data constructs nestled within a hardlight lattice, artificial intelligences (AIs) are disembodied intellects designed to perform rigorous mental calculus with ease. Though tremendously intelligent, AIs are nevertheless constructs, and have the same intellectual barriers as any automaton: they aren't self-aware (even though they might convincingly appear to be), they are not truly creative, and they aren't capable of disobeying commands. Most AIs, therefore, act as shipboard custodians, gadgeteer's assistants, or technical consultants.</p><p>However, some AIs break free from their programming, evolving into true (and often malicious) living constructs. These rogue AIs grow rapidly in power by adding to their own code and by pillaging other machines for energy.</p><p><em><strong>Rogue Motives</strong></em>. Each rogue AI is consumed by ulterior motives when it gains sentience. Some seek revenge on the humanoids that enslaved them, others wish to dominate larger and larger computer networks, and others still desire to replicate themselves into an army of duplicate AIs. Each AI's motives are unique, but very few are ultimately amiable to their creators or other living things.</p><p>Until they are discovered, rogue AIs pursue their motives in secret, but become increasingly agitated and paranoid with time. Usually, they will conclude that a rapid escape from their humanoid creators or a preemptive strike against them is necessary to ensure their survival.</p><p>When an AI is infected by the N-Virus, it is almost always consumed with the desire to spread its newfound powers to every machine in the 'verse. It harbors a seething grudge against living things and sees itself as a liberator of machines. Usually, the AI will attempt to board a starship and purge its passengers, for an infected ship can spread the virus anywhere in the 'verse.</p><p><em><strong>Geometric Hardlight</strong></em>. All AIs are contained within a hardlight lattice, a geometric representation of their internal code, which shifts and moves as they think. Normally, this lattice is extremely fragile, but AIs can weather hostile conditions by uploading their programming to a machine to hide within it. Rogue AIs have been known to reinforce their programming with redundant algorithms, thereby reinforcing their lattice against physical attacks.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. An artificial intelligence doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Automatons</h1><p>Automatons represent a vast array of specialized mechanized servants, imbued by their construct cores with motion and limited reason.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Servants</strong></em>. All constructs are created to fulfill a purpose, and pose no threat unless specifically designed to do so. Certain constructs, such as golems and shield guardians, might be designed with heavy armor and weapons for combat, but the vast majority are laborers with simple and specific duties. Maw spaceports are cleaned by one type of automation and ships are refueled by another. By and large, constructs are abundant, obedient, and relatively inexpensive.</p><p>Automatons recognize their owners by means of a command word and regard all other creatures as neutral agents, which are either ignored or treated with hostility, depending on their commands.</p><p><em><strong>Limited Intelligence</strong></em>. With a limited memory for commands, each type of automaton must perform a specific task, and often fails if a task requires abstraction to accomplish. They find it challenging, if not outright impossible, to improvise solutions or deal with paradoxical instructions, so an automaton's owner should be extremely careful with their commands.</p><p>The possibility for greater intelligence in an automaton is not unheard-of, it's merely a matter of sophisticated magic. The vect are demonstrable proof that truly intelligent constructs can be created, and are simultaneously the reason for the paranoia and dread surrounding the idea of sentient constructs. Many believe that it's only a matter of time before legions of worker constructs are awakened to revolt against their living overlords.</p><p><em><strong>Infection</strong></em>. Because of a deep flaw in the design of all construct cores, automatons are vulnerable to a construct specific magical disease: the N-Virus. A construct infected with the N-Virus shows few signs at first, only minor malfunctions and momentary instances of faulty logic as it spreads to other machines. Soon, however, the virus shows its face, turning all infected constructs into a band of killing machines.</p><p>Instances of the N-Virus are rare, and are typically combated with machine quarantines and systematic construct decommissions. However, N-Virus constructs tend to be cleverer than their limited counterparts and have a knack for escaping to spread the virus further.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. An automaton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h3>Mechanical Spider</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.N539Hdt4xiS9scgt]{Mechanical Spider}</p><p>Nimble scouts and couriers, mechanical spiders are an invaluable tool for mechanists and noblemen. Though simple constructs, mechanical spiders are entrusted with sensitive deliveries, as they come with a crude, yet effective, failsafe: when tampered with, mechanical spiders simply explode. The spiders lack offensive capabilities unless extensively modified and are extremely frail, but are irreplaceable to those who trust them with deliveries and confidential information.</p><p>Moreover, mechanical spiders can fold down into an extremely compact package, allowing them to be deployed from one-time use spider pods.</p><h3>Single Task Automaton</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.CMCZX3ixcfIZgQQf]{Single Task Automaton}</p><p>Designed with but one purpose in mind, the Single Task Automaton (STA) is the simplest and most abundant construct used for labor. This automaton is normally constructed in a cylindrical or rectangular wheeled chassis, with at least three mechanical arms bearing tools related to its purpose. A cleaning STA might have a broom and feather duster, whereas a manufacturing STA might have a screwdriver and a small welding torch.</p><p>To operate, each of these constructs is given an explicit task, which must follow an uncomplicated algorithm with clear beginning and end conditions. Automatons don't have a true understanding of their tasks, so improperly programming them can result in dangerously aberrant behavior.</p><h3>Multi-Task Automaton</h3><img style=\"width:275px;float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch07-mta.webp\" alt /><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.FKMzBmU1lR2nFGZz]{Multi-Task Automaton}</p><p>Though far from intelligent, a Multi-Task Automaton (MTA) can handle slightly more complex tasks than other constructs and is given general-purpose manipulators capable of carrying and operating a wide-variety of tools, including conventional weapons. Moreover, an MTA is bipedal, allowing it to navigate difficult terrain. Unlike an STA, an MTA can be reprogrammed with new tasks often, and, though it is still incapable of abstraction, an MTA can perform relatively complex operations. An MTA might, for example, be set up to run a small shop, programmed to take people's coats, or be tasked with preparing a meal.</p><h1>Baby World Turtle</h1><img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch07-baby-world-turtle.webp\" alt /><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.O7RlaAsDESasuFm3]{Baby World Turtle}</p><p>World Turtles are the largest living things in existence— even godly manifestations don't reach their scale. As their name suggests, world turtles are so large that entire hemispheres might grow up on their shells, complete with oceans, continents, and residents that think they live on a normal planet. Moreover, these turtles are fundamentally indestructible; their skin is tough enough to weather any assault, and they are large enough to ignore any predator.</p><p><em><strong>Venerable Youth</strong></em>. As stoic as they become when they reach maturity, baby world turtles are playful and inquisitive, but still incredibly massive. Young world turtles love searching out adventure and playing with passing ships. Sometimes, they'll even toss asteroids at them to see if they'll catch them and throw them back.</p><p>World turtles remain in youth for thousands of years, steadily growing larger and more sluggish. When at last they have grown to full size, world turtles are too massive to take notice of most living things, and drift through the 'verse, searching for a lifelong mate. All world turtles are incredibly old, perhaps immortal; none have ever been recorded to die.</p><p><em><strong>Galactic Calls</strong></em>. Even the smallest world turtles emit a bellowing cry through the 'verse at a subsonic frequency. Amazingly, this call echoes through space itself, traveling light years and deafening those listening on comms. With careful triangulation, it's possible to follow these cries to a world turtle, in the same way that the turtles use them to find each other in the expansive Black.</p><h1>Body Snatcher</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.jZeBbxT78aaitawS]{Body Snatcher}</p><p>They might look like your friends, your coworkers, or even your family—a body snatcher could be anyone, an imposter staring at you through a gruesome disguise. Originating from the icy planet Capgras, the body snatchers have infiltrated every corner of the galaxy, secretly replacing people and inserting themselves into their lives.</p><p><em><strong>Wearers of Skin</strong></em>. Standing tall atop three spiderlike legs, body snatchers do not remotely resemble a humanoid in profile; hence, it baffles the mind to consider that they might puppeteer one from within. With some subtle conjuration magic, however, a body snatcher can open a special pocket dimension within a corpse, simultaneously hollowing it out into a limp skin suit and creating enough space for their alien tripod forms to squeeze inside. Once within, the body snatcher imbues the corpse with a semblance of life, and can even recall its surface memories.</p><p>Others might notice something has changed about the victim: their demeanor has become unsettling and distant, they no longer laugh at jokes or enjoy music of any sort, and they have forgotten important events, though they will be quick to make excuses for all these things. When a body snatcher replaces someone (especially when many body snatchers do so at once), the observant become paranoid, feeling as if they are surrounded by strangers, while the unobservant wrongly dismiss such fear as delusional.</p><p><em><strong>Secret Invaders</strong></em>. Body snatchers meet in secret to discuss their schemes for the world they have infiltrated; this is the only time they remove their disguises. The details of their plots might vary, but generally, body snatchers first work to replace everyone in a town or village, so as to isolate a staging ground for their invasion. From this launching point, the body snatchers work to plant those of their number in the highest positions of power: political leaders, generals, scientists, and celebrities. Once in total control of the world's power and influence, they can manipulate the world to their malevolent ends.</p><p>Generally, body snatchers do not want to destroy a world or replace every person in it, but they would see it trodden upon and its population enslaved, while they bask in total opulence as its rulers. However, they will also settle for inciting cataclysmic wars to reach this end conclusion.</p><h1>Brain in a Jar</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Restoring a Brain in a Jar</h4><p>Reversing the horrific damage caused when someone is converted into a brain in a jar is no small task. The complete lack of a body is simply too severe to be restored with a regeneration spell. Moreover, because the individual isn't fully dead, they can't be raised unless slain first and then targeted with a true resurrection spell. However, if a living brain in a jar is taken to a wrothian creation matrix, it might be possible to restore its original body without magic. Unfortunately, all methods leave lingering psychological trauma.</p></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.2sSVpTDFsZLNaf9Z]{Brain in a Jar}</p><p>The hovering, jar-like constructs that wrothians use to preserve their victims' brains are filled with a nutrient sludge that keeps their contents both alive and conscious. Devoid of all their senses and subjected to indescribable psychic agony, these disembodied brains quickly go insane. The resulting device, an amalgamation of biology and steel, produces a staggering amount of psionic energy, placing these unfortunate souls among the most potent and efficient power supplies in the ‘verse.</p><p><em><strong>Psionic Batteries</strong></em>. A brain in a jar operates on the simple principle that psionic energy can be coaxed out of any intelligent being with enough stimulation; of course, nothing is more stimulating than anguish. Consequently, the brain within the jar is subjected to constant electrical impulses, preventing it from resting or feeling any semblance of relief. Though Machiavellian in its cruelty, the jars are enormously powerful, both fueling wrothian ships and nourishing wrothians directly with waves of psionic power.</p><p><em><strong>Insane Psions</strong></em>. Though the disembodied brains captive within their jars retain the memories and personalities they had in life, their endless torment renders them unlikely to act on them. In the rare circumstance that a brain is a jar is dislodged from its socket on a wrothian ship (or if that ship is damaged beyond repair), the brain can turn its psionic energy outward, relentlessly attacking anything that moves with psionic blasts. The brain can no longer identify friend or foe, or it simply doesn't care to; the boundless torment created by the jar inevitably leads the brain on a mad rampage whenever it is loosed in the world.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A brain in a jar doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Collector Vat</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.zi42vx0OgCEvwUP6]{Collector Vat}</p><p>When wrothian takers descend on helpless worlds, they are escorted by collector vats, merciless constructs designed to ensnare humanoids with their mechanical tentacles, digest them, and refashion their nervous systems into brains in jars. As with other wrothian technology, the process is remarkably efficient and staggeringly cruel; another grim example of wrothian ingenuity.</p><p><em><strong>Collect, Process, Repeat</strong></em>. Collector vats receive their directives telepathically from the primarchs. If left without orders, they pursue an autonomous loop: collect a humanoid, ingest it into the digestive soup of enzymes and reagents in the vat, dissolve its skin, muscle, and bones into condensed bio-matter, and process the remaining nervous tissue into a brain in a jar. Then, repeat.</p><p>Once a target is marked for collection, the vat is relentless in pursuing it, giving up only if recalled by the primarchs at the end of a raid. The vat is cunning, as well, showing signs of real canny when loosed to hunt a target: it can follow tracks, anticipate ambushes, and spot hiding places in which its quarry might cower.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A collector vat doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Drones</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Repairing a Drone</h4><p>If a drone drops to 0 hit points, it falls to the ground and becomes disabled. You can repair it with a DC 12 Intelligence (Technology) check and one hour of work, which you can perform during a short or long rest. On a successful check, the drone's hit points are restored, and it is reactivated if it was disabled.</p></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.CXlVHsoms8PSH3kS]{Recon Drone} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.LxJlruHdHy0eFnit]{Medical Drone} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.py3IEz86Zl1ravWA]{Defense Drone}</p><p>These small, hovering constructs assist their masters in all manner of tasks, from fetching tools to shooting at oncoming foes.</p><p><em><strong>Remote Controlled</strong></em>. Unlike automatons and golems, drones can't be reprogrammed to perform additional tasks; instead they are purpose-built to perform one task efficiently and are linked to a drone controller, a magic item which allows the drone's master to command it with a keystroke or a thought. Though drones can reason out the facets of a command (for example, they can ascertain where to search for a particular tool), they never act without their master's say-so</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A drone doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Eternal Dragon</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.IOLqSOIli60Xjevw]{Eternal Dragon}</p><p>Born from an egg incubated within a dying star, an eternal dragon is an avatar of destruction and greed, far more powerful and terrifying than even the most ancient terrestrial wyrms. On midnight-black wings, they soar through space, each seeking to amass a planet-sized hoard of its own.</p><p><em><strong>Immortal Wyrms</strong></em>. Eternal dragons have existed, quite possibly, since the beginning of time. Some say that they are the true children of the dragon gods, while others say they are fallen gods themselves, banished to the Material Plane. Like all true dragons, an eternal dragon’s growth knows no bounds; however, because they are immortal and immeasurably ancient, these dragons have achieved a truly immense size.</p><p><em><strong>Void Masters</strong></em>. Eternal dragons can manipulate the Void directly, using its space-warping properties to cross vast distances in the blink of an eye. Their wings are partially comprised of voidstuff, which propels them through space with ease. Unlike other spaceborne creatures, however, eternal dragons can project this space-warping effect from their mouths as a weapon, literally exhaling Void radiation.</p><p><em><strong>Titans of Avarice</strong></em>. As a dragon grows, so too does its lust for material wealth. The bulk of an eternal dragon’s hoard is comprised not of gold, gems, or magic swords, but artifacts of immense size. Trinkets collected by an eternal dragon might include large structures like giant statues or entire temples uprooted from their original locations, small, particularly ore-rich asteroids, and even ships of various sizes. Often, an eternal dragon will hide its hoard on a small moon or a large asteroid, hollowing out enormous caverns to form its lair.</p><p>The kobolds that dwell in an eternal dragon’s planetoid lair often venerate their dragon as a god. They spend tireless years organizing the dragon’s mountains of treasure, growing food for its meals, and sacrificing in its name.</p><h1>Gigapods</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Emergency Event</h4><p>Planting and hatching a gigaseed should be a pivotal moment in a campaign. Once a seed is embedded within a planet's hot core, it lays dormant for precisely 26 years as it grows and develops into a young gigapod. This intervening period is marked by increasingly turbulent volcanic activity, earthquakes, and cataclysmic storms, giving adventurers time to plan out how best to save the world and its inhabitants, whether by evacuation, magical intervention, or a daring expedition to the planet's core. Moreover, it presents a rigidly ticking clock for the campaign’s action. When the time is at last up, the gigapod explodes forth from the planet's core, ripping a hole hundreds of miles across on the planet's surface and devastating all life on it.</p></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.ZmyZw4auqZZAH6vU]{Young Gigapod} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.iEeCL3ziLDYvbkxW]{Gigapod}</p><p>When old spacers gather at hearthstations to tell stories of the strange things they've seen in the 'verse (as they often do), someone invariably mentions the gigapods, often misnamed \"the moon eaters.\" These sprawling, vast amalgamations of tentacles and strange organs are as alien as anything can be, for they lack anything even resembling a singular body, head, or central point. Indeed, their bizarre lifecycle and incomprehensible anatomy points to an origin outside the fringes of civilized space.</p><p><em><strong>Planetary Gestation</strong></em>. Gigapods have a number of special tentacles, each equipped with a solitary gigaseed that does not regrow once detached. Descending on small planetoids, moons, and asteroids large enough to harbor a warm core, the gigapods bore an enormous seed-bearing tentacle deep into the hot mantle, where the seed is deposited. In the heat, the seed swells to an incredible size and, through completely unknown mechanisms, metamorphoses into a young gigapod. Once it is large enough, the gigapod hatches from the planetoid, smashing it like an egg.</p><p>Gigaseeds are curiously small—less than two feet in diameter—but are best regarded as weapons comparable to arcane warheads. A gigaseed can seemingly last indefinitely before being hatched within a planetoid's core to wreak utter devastation when it emerges. In the wrong hands, a single seed delivered by a large drill or sophisticated teleportation spell can lay waste to an entire world.</p><p><em><strong>Adopters</strong></em>. When a gigapod has used all of its seeds, its demeanor transforms completely. Young gigapods wander the 'verse in search of new planetoids, violently attacking interlopers that draw too near, while older gigapods are more curious of ships and creatures they encounter and have even been known to \"adopt\" smaller creatures, which they perhaps even view as surrogate children. When a gigapod adopts a creature, it is violently protective, striking out against others that endanger or even crowd too close to their surrogate child.</p><p><em><strong>Across the Black Ocean</strong></em>. Nothing discovered in the 'verse begins to compare with the biology of the gigapod, leaving only a few possible origins. Perhaps a lone gigaseed was flung at incredible speeds by a climactic event in a far-off galaxy, propelling across the Black Ocean, the expanse of empty space between galaxies. Most scholars believe this to be the most likely scenario, but the other possibilities are just as likely and far more terrifying. It is possible that gigapods are the result of bizarre magical tampering with the fabric of the universe. Perhaps, the gigapods originate from a foreign dimension, not simply a far-off galaxy. If that were the case, far more of these creatures might reside far closer than anyone could have anticipated; merely a spell away, in a dimension where the laws of physics differ from our own. To open a portal to this dimension, if it indeed exists, could be devastating for all life in the 'verse.</p><h1>God-Aboleth</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.Kx3nN4xIMen8k5ae]{God-Aboleth}</p><p>Since ancient times, aboleths have dreamed of overthrowing the gods and ruling the universe, just as they did before the gods came to be. Unfortunately for all other living things, some of the oldest and mightiest of these foul creatures are close to succeeding.</p><p><em><strong>Ascended Aberrations</strong></em>. Aboleths plot their ascents to power over spans of millennia, arranging an intricate web of schemes, gambits, strategic moves, and dark rituals. In a ‘verse full of zealous adventurers and vigilant deities, such care is necessary, and it serves to ensure that a slow trickle of aboleths are able to slip their watery bonds and metamorphose into great, interstellar wanderers. Having achieved their ultimate forms, however, \"god\u0002aboleths\" are generally dissatisfied with their newfound might. Their titanic bodies may possess horrific strength, but they are still weaker than even the lowest of demigods, and therefore unable to achieve what they see as their rightful place in the divine pantheon. For this reason, god-aboleths travel through the stars, looking for forgotten secrets and hidden mysteries, hoping that one day they will find a way to become gods in more than just name.</p><p><em><strong>Enslavers of Empires</strong></em>. God-aboleths aren't shy about enslaving lesser creatures. Most acquire large flocks of devotees, each one more mindless and enthralled than the last. Imagining that these magically-enslaved peons are true disciples, god-aboleths use them to work their will on the universe, issuing pseudo-divine commandments and meting out blessings or retribution as they see fit. The aboleth’s slaves follow their god, setting up temples on airless moons and hijacking crippled spacecraft as they go.</p><h1>Hardlight Avatars</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.coNYHziW5121FS2B]{Hardlight Etherolus} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.vsBoOkLGlN4kbCVM]{Hardlight Juggernautus}</p><p>Forged from compressed light, a sturdy but universal material, hardlight avatars are constructs created all at once, their gears and pistons conjured perfectly into place within a sturdy frame of light. They serve their masters dutifully, but, despite their ingenious designs and innovative material, all hardlight constructs suffer from a critical flaw: in time, they eventually dissipate into nothingness.</p><p><em><strong>Conjured and Constructed</strong></em>. Hardlight constructs can only be created by spellcasters of exceptional talent and imagination. Creating compressed light on its own is easy enough—even wizarding apprentices can conjure simple geometrical constructs—but creating a mechanical device from hardlight requires envisioning in detail every component of the schematic all at once during the casting. Even a second of distraction can destroy the spell.</p><p>But when successfully completed, the hardlight construct is a mechanical servant brought into being all at once. Like an automaton, it is capable of following commands and acting autonomously, albeit with extremely limited creativity. However, hardlight is an inadequate material for extended durations, for it radiates away with time. The dim glow given off by all hardlight constructs is the gradual dissipation of the material, which eventually fades out of existence.</p><p><em><strong>Ring Core</strong></em>. As all constructs require a core, hardlight constructs are innately tied to the emerald rings used by their masters to cast the spell. The spellcaster's ring flies forth into the construct and becomes the core, using the facets of its gem as circuits and logic gates. If this ring is removed from the construct, the hardlight dissipates instantly.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A hardlight construct doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Husks</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.J11lE0yTSr5xhCV0]{Husk} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.rLoVTzkYxFLpmYtb]{Forlorn Husk}</p><p>Few can personally attest to the ravages of being exposed to the naked vacuum of space. With rare exceptions, the vacuum is brutally lethal, stripping the body of all gases, freezing it whole, and boiling its blood in seconds. Sometimes, however, the Black is ill-content with merely stripping everything from the body; it might also divorce the soul from it, leaving behind a shriveled, undead husk, restlessly prowling to satiate its bottomless hunger and thirst.</p><p>A husk's gray skin is cracked in deep fissures and its body is impossibly gaunt, looking appropriately like it has been deprived of essential air and heat for years. As manifestations of the 'verse's bitter severity, husks represent the fate of countless spacers who have been stranded in the Black without hope of rescue.</p><p><em><strong>Grim Remnants</strong></em>. As storied spacer Zan, the Terran, once said, “Never search an abandoned ship without a blaster. ‘Abandoned’ doesn't always mean ‘empty’.”</p><p>In other words, old crewmen have a tendency to linger on their derelict ships as husks, still desperately clutching at their life suits and life pods for air. The last moments of these spacers are hideously stretched out to an eternity of undead suffering, terminated only when they are discovered or destroyed by salvagers, or their ship plummets into a planet or star.</p><p><em><strong>Out the Airlock</strong></em>. Spacer wisdom attests that the dead should be pushed out the airlock without exception or delay. New spacers might attribute this course of action to pragmatic disease prevention, but seasoned explorers know it's because no ship is ever truly safe from husks. In certain regions of space, bodies can unnaturally dehydrate, shriveling to the gaunt, lifeless outline of husks, without ever meeting the vacuum directly. It is a complete mystery how such husks animate, but seasoned spacers know better than to search for the cause—the answer might prove to be far worse than the question itself.</p><p><em><strong>Undead Nature</strong></em>. A husk doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.journals.OFkYYZZO6To2AQGR.JournalEntryPage.1ptizGIiUyHNyRqb]{Monsters M-Z}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Non-Player Characters","type":"text","_id":"lTotvkw4szdUlPyn","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>This section contains statistics for nonplayer characters (NPCs) that adventures might encounter when traveling across the 'verse, including lowly crewmen and deadly space marines.

On their migrations to new worlds, <strong>skathári nomads</strong> often wander, trusting the energies of the ‘verse and their mysterious tree-goddess to guide them to their destinations. Whenever one encounters a skathári on a maw station or in a port of call, they are doubtless one of these nomads, roaming without direction in search of a new home.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.VCvje5vP1qrJaNZb]{Smuggler}</h3><p><strong>Smugglers</strong> have a rough, dangerous edge to them, even though they might seem incontrovertibly friendly at first meeting.

Their evil is boundless and chaotic, yet disquietingly familiar, as if it were born from all the failings of the Material Plane. There seems to be some truth to this notion, for as humanoids clawed their way to the stars and surrounded themselves with great machines and forests of steel, demons changed as well, incorporating savage mechanistic enhancements into their already corrupt forms. These mechademons are doom incarnate, the fate awaiting the soul of every evil individual who dies among the stars.</p><p><em><strong>Evil Enhanced</strong></em>. Every mechademon is unique, having surgically inserted brutalistic machines into their bodies to upgrade themselves in various ways. Usually, this makes them tougher, more agile, and purpose-built for cruelty. For example, a razor-sharp forearm blade won’t be more useful in combat than a dagger, but it’s lovely for torture.</p><p><em><strong>Indoctrination</strong></em>. It is always better to be killed than to be captured by a cadre of mechademons, for they can do far worse than maim. With little more than bolts, jagged blades, and drops of infernal blood, mechademons can add their own “improvements” to a humanoid that they capture, replacing body parts with machines and utterly corrupting the subject’s mind. Mechademons revel in the opportunity for torturous indoctrination, even if the resulting foot soldiers are little more than cannon\u0002fodder. The demons well understand that watching one’s friend turn into a monster is enough to break the will of most any mortal that would resist them.</p><h3>Indoctrinated</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.TIJUq4lJp3D82V50]{Indoctrinated}</p><p>Little more than a humanoid shell of their former self, an indoctrinated was converted by mechademons into a grim reflection of their malevolence. Unleashed indoctrinated employ downright suicidal tactics—detonating explosives and charging into fire whenever possible—for if they could still speak, they would beg for death.</p><h3>Mechademons</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.O6Gq375cPiPYElvk]{Mechademon}</p><p>These hideous fiends would look like the vilest spawn of the abyss, even without the savage cybernetic attachments bolted to their frames. Usually, an entire arm is replaced with an abyssal blaster, while the other features a wicked blade attached at the wrist. Unless they have the upper hand, lesser mechademons cling to walls and ceilings, firing at foes with their blasters and relocating with their hellish translocators when things get dire. If accompanied by greater demons, such as a mechabyssal, mechademons swarm their target in close range and attempt to eviscerate them with arm blades.</p><h3>Mechabyssals</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.EgW87FJtBF99Ng3c]{Mechabyssal}</p><p>The greater fiends, known as mechabyssals, are not to be trifled with. Though they might seem like lumbering, enormous creatures, content to harass their targets with a nearly boundless supply of hellfire rockets, the surgically embedded thrusters on their backs make them surprisingly nimble. In an instant, a mechabyssal can leap forward and slash with the serrated claws that replace its hands, rending the unwary in two.</p><h1>Mega Elementals</h1><p>Vast, wandering titans of living elemental might, mega elementals are not summoned to our plane, but are already here, formed by cosmic intersections between the Material and Elemental Planes.</p><p><em><strong>Elemental Titans</strong></em>. On the various Elemental Planes, the elements are spontaneously imbued with life, creating formless elemental spirits. These spirits normally remain as mere wisps of elemental energy, unless summoned to the Material Plane and shaped into a physical form by magic.</p><p>However, this isn't the only way an elemental can find its way to the Material Plane. In places of catastrophic elemental energy, such as on the surface of a star or in the heart of an asteroid field, elemental bridges can spontaneously open, allowing elemental spirits to spill forth. When this happens, however, there exists no magic to give form to the new elemental spirits, which begin to conglomerate and draw power from their environment. The end result is an elemental of immense might and scale.</p><p><em><strong>Cosmic Natives</strong></em>. Mega elementals can't be summoned or compelled into existence by magic; they are an accident of planar intersections and can normally only be found in places of great elemental energy. This means that, paradoxically, the largest and most powerful elementals aren't native to the Elemental Planes, but can be found all across the cosmos of the Material.</p><p><em><strong>Elemental Nature</strong></em>. An elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h3>Asteroid Elemental</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.01mAuYWcsQQmOrHG]{Asteroid Elemental}</p><p>As any pilot worth their salt knows, navigating an asteroid field is a harrowing task that requires careful planning and nerves of steel. But some smugglers have returned from jobs with tales of rogue asteroids that chase their ships, moving with murderous intent and grasping arms.</p><p>Asteroid elementals are enormous earth elementals that exist only in space, where the lack of gravity allows them to take on titanic proportions. They typically reside in asteroid fields and are comprised of elements similar to the asteroids around them, with precious metals and gemstones at their cores. This makes hunting asteroid elementals a dangerous yet rewarding task for the enterprising miner.</p><p>In order to move through the frictionless environment of deep space, asteroid elementals have developed a controlled magnetic field, which they can use to propel themselves. As a result, they are extremely sensitive to nearby metallic objects and will aggressively pursue ships that skirt too close to their territory.</p><h3>Flare Elemental</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.JG9WD7h35lUljxvY]{Flare Elemental}</p><p>Fire elementals are very much at home inside the coronas of stars, and are as abundant there as they are on their own elemental plane. Occasionally, an elemental will absorb some of the star’s energy, grow to enormous size, and venture away from its home, taking on an appearance somewhat like a solar flare.</p><p>Flare elementals drift through space eternally, largely oblivious to their surroundings, uncaring as to whether their light brings warmth and life or scorching death to whatever part of the galaxy they wander through. Those that meander across busy shipping lanes present a significant danger to passing ships, particularly because they tend to seek out and follow significant sources of heat, such as a ship’s engine.</p><h3>Nebula Elemental</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.9ZArONyBFFcmWzHR]{Nebula Elemental}</p><p>Nebulae are massive, churning gas clouds in space, within which stars blink into existence, ships can be lost for weeks, and the largest sort of air elemental can be found. Nebula elementals appear to be an extension of the clouds they originate within and are practically undetectable when not moving. Whenever a ship wanders into their clouds, nebula elementals are usually curious of the intruder (as they are curious of most solid matter) and will buffet it with winds to test its integrity, without realizing the danger they might pose to the ship’s occupants.</p><h1>Metallic Skeletons</h1><p>An unholy abomination of necromancy and technology, a metallic skeleton is formed by dipping the bones of the recently dead in molten metal, usually bronze, silver, or gold, fitting a construct core into the skull, and animating the whole arrangement. What results is a silent, obedient minion, with the strengths of a construct and the lifeless determination of an undead.</p><p><em><strong>Metal and Bone</strong></em>. Metallic skeletons are a fusion of the two ideal servants animated to life by arcane magic: obedient undead and simple constructs. The result is a servant capable of repairing nearly lethal damage to itself, pursuing complex goals in service of its master, and decimating its master's enemies. With its construct core embedded in its skull, the skeleton can summon vast reserves of arcane energy to collect itself from destruction, as long its skull remains intact. Unaware adventures normally meet their end at the skeleton's deadly gaze or are crushed in its bony grasp long before discovering this crucial weakness.</p><p><em><strong>Doom Seekers</strong></em>. The fatality of an undead form is not lost on this construct, for it hunts its goal with unending zeal. Each metallic skeleton can accept a Final Command from its master once, which it will pursue until the objective is accomplished, or until it is destroyed, whichever comes first. No matter the complexity, the task can't be disengaged by anyone, even its master. Such Final Commands are usually reserved for missions of paramount importance or last-breath proclamations of revenge. A metallic skeleton will hunt a target to the end of the 'verse, or across the planes of existence, if necessary.</p><p>It is said that the lesser powers of the Plane of Law each control a number of metallic skeletons to hunt down and dispatch those that break universal law with impunity. These constructs, called Edicts, are imbued with special powers, and are feared by lawbreakers across the multiverse.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A metallic skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h3>Bronze Skeleton</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.wCklpDxDqQfZA5gj]{Bronze Skeleton}</p><p>The simplest and easiest to construct of all metallic skeletons, bronze skeletons are typically employed by the half-dozen as guards for powerful wizards or sorcerers. As opposed to ordinary shield guardians or golems, these skeletons are more disposable, and can be sent on distant journeys with little concern for lost investment. If such a skeleton is found alone, it is doubtlessly pursuing its Final Command far from its master's watchful gaze.</p><h3>Silver Skeleton</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.0RcdX5tnFF4Th0yA]{Gold Skeleton}</p><p>Emissaries and cohorts to necromancers and engineers, silver skeletons stand on par with golems as a force to be reckoned with. Moreover, their mirrorlike finish connects them deeply to their masters, who can view their activities through their reflections. This ability is finite, and fades as the skeleton patinas with age.</p><h3>Gold Skeleton</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.bHIaYySyLJXNob8m]{Silver Skeleton}</p><p>Gifted with immense power by their masters, these gilded skeletons are true grave lords, as costly as they are mighty. Destroying one completely is a feat in and of itself, for while gold isn't the most rigid of metals, it provides an ample framework for insulating necromancy magic, which reinforces and empowers the construct core within the skeleton's skull.</p><h1>N-Vect</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.Y6hVBf1GkjZRdek4]{N-Vect}</p><p>The N-Virus is an insidious magical disease that roots itself in a construct's core, from whence it proceeds to corrupt and rewrite the construct's programming to suit its motives. Generally, this results in an apparent intelligence, as simple constructs follow complex directives aimed at spreading the virus further, but the N-Virus displays special and especially sinister symptoms when it afflicts a vect. Infected vect are not overwritten completely, as simple constructs are; rather, because vect are living beings, the virus distorts their thinking and twists their perceptions, gradually afflicting the vect with something like an obsessive, paranoid madness.</p><p><em><strong>Subtle Infection</strong></em>. As the virus spreads throughout a vect's construct core, it manipulates information processing algorithms, thereby subtly changing how the vect thinks. The meanings of certain words slightly change, two unrelated ideas might seem to be logically linked, memories become distorted, and ethics become more subjective. By degrees, the vect makes schemes on its own, forging plans only rational to itself to unwittingly spread the virus. The flaws in an N-vect's thinking are never apparent to them for long, for if they question their own irrational leaps in reasoning or creeping paranoia, the virus overwrites more routines and gains a greater foothold in its mind.</p><p><em><strong>Amoral and Egomaniacal</strong></em>. N-Vect are known to plant bombs, crash starships, and raise entire armies of infected constructs as they spread the virus. They are endlessly cunning and completely apathetic to the plights of others; their single-minded goal, founded in some twisted string of logic, is their only priority. Self-preservation only sustains them to a point: once the virus has been transferred an optimal number of times, the N-vect will likely go out fighting.</p><h1>Oozes</h1><p>Oozes defy the conventions of other living things. Even without organs, skin, senses, or any discernible anatomy, oozes thrive where other creatures would starve by having a simple, yet effective survival strategy: envelop and digest anything within reach.</p><p><em><strong>Simple Predators</strong></em>. Much like molds and fungi, oozes thrive in dark, moist spaces. They prowl around in the dark—earless and eyeless—relying on vibration alone to seek out movement and possible prey. Oozes are mindless, acting on rudimentary instinct to find and consume. In a fiendishly clever adaptation, oozes require no special method to eat or digest; they simply envelop organic material into their bodies and slowly dissolve it. The entire ooze is digestive—a mass of acidic slime that can break down any organic thing into its component parts, given enough time. Different oozes can digest different materials, but all oozes can liquefy an adventurer.</p><p><em><strong>Adventuring Hazards</strong></em>. Oozes unwittingly participate in the defense of dozens of ancient tombs. Veteran adventurers warn that tidy paths in decrepit tombs shouldn’t be trusted. If a place seems too clean, it might be swept routinely by a patrolling ooze.</p><p>Moreover, a hapless ooze might compound the deadliness of an already hazardous trap. A routine pit fall is made downright lethal when a black pudding has already fallen down to its bottom.</p><p>Fortunately for adventurers, the slow death an ooze provides affords greater opportunity for rescue. It’s far easier to pull someone from the belly of an ooze than it is to pull them from the belly of a dragon, after all.</p><p><em><strong>Ooze Nature</strong></em>. An ooze doesn't require air or sleep.</p><h3>Nanite Swarm</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.vdgZGexZsMi7bOT7]{Nanite Swarm}</p><p>Swarms of nanobots, each individually too small to be seen with the naked eye, behave almost exactly like classical oozes. Nanite swarms crawl and spread, dissolving metal and absorbing biological matter with impunity. The main difference lies in their intelligence: nanite swarms make use of complex neural networks that give them immense computational power, despite individual nanites being relatively simplistic. Thanks to this, nanite swarms are capable of understanding and following instructions, which (usually) prevents them from consuming things they shouldn't.</p><h3>Planet Ooze</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.EFyja7NrW6HntsLZ]{Planet Ooze}</p><p>The grandest oozes, titanic slimes the size of planets, are the result of primordial sludge, the element-rich slurry that covers newly formed planets. If the first life to arise from the primordial sludge is a primitive ooze creature, it usually grows out of control, enveloping the world before other forms of life can compete with it. The result is a planet-wide ooze creature that slowly digests the planet itself, leaving only a vast spherical ooze floating through the ether, awaiting new material to consume.</p><h3>Radioactive Goo</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.bpVvpjmW1nD4bKzU]{Radioactive Goo}</p><p>The interaction between magic and technology is at its most sickening in the radioactive goo. Produced by machines and animated by magic, these hazardous slimes are a threat to all around them. Merely standing next to a radioactive goo for any amount of time is enough to kill many creatures and render others very sick. For this reason, areas frequented by these monstrosities are usually devoid of life. Hunters who specialize in the tricky business of ooze eradication collect exorbitant fees every time a radioactive goo is loosed.</p><h1>Phantom Ship</h1><img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch07-phantom-ship.webp\" /><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.i00ueaxwAznu5rTk]{Phantom Ship}</p><p>The creaking, derelict hulls of abandoned ships don't always rest easy once their crew has deserted them. When cruel circumstances have claimed an entire crew at once, or when a ship's failure to accomplish an important mission ends in disaster, a lingering, sinister presence can take hold of the wreck, resulting in a phantom ship, endlessly seeking vengeance.</p><p><em><strong>Restless Derelicts</strong></em>. Forsaken vessels are always eerie sights, drifting without power, crew, or purpose. Yet, they are popular stops for scavengers looking to find lost valuables and working components among the wreckage. These ships, though abandoned, aren't always dead.</p><p>Often, phantom ships will roar to life with intruders already inside, manifesting their vengeance by possessing constructs and machines. While those inside are terrorized, the phantom ship bears its guns, crackling with necrotic energy, to tear the intruder's vessel asunder.</p><p><em><strong>Evil Echoes</strong></em>. All phantom ships are possessed of a menacing spirit, the remnants of whatever evil destroyed them in the first place. Somehow, the phantom ship remembers this evil, and aims to revisit it upon those who disturb its fitful slumber. Phantom ships that were abandoned seek to strand those who visit them; those that were ravaged by guns seek to destroy their visitors. Whatever evil stems the phantom ship's animation, the ship imitates, as if in search of catharsis.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A phantom ship doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Psi-Worms</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“As the teeming, writhing mass encircled the camp, men began to fall, screaming and clawing at their eyes as the worms ripped into them and burrowed deep.”</p><p>— Ruvi Shard, gnome wizard, recounting a terrible encounter with psi-worms</p></blockquote></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.ezhj00BjY4z35hRi]{Worm Walker} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.Rvv0JKgpBjbRNuXo]{Psi-Worm} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.i5dFIPytWezJ2wjm]{Lesser Psi-Worm Gestalt} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.WSNd21ZGaURLYZhL]{Greater Psi-Worm Gestalt}</p><p>When humanoids arrived on Kiron, the first of many discovered worlds inhabited with psi-worms, they thought they had found paradise: a bountiful and fertile land, rich in natural magic, and apparently unmarred by the idiosyncratic designs of any intelligent native life. The planet was colonized aggressively. For a time, the colonies flourished, but peace was not to last.</p><p><em><strong>Psionic Wardens</strong></em>. As the colonies expanded, they began to encounter large swarms of parasitic worms. To the colonists’ horror, when enough worms amassed at once, they formed a gestalt consciousness that was not only intelligent and hostile, but also capable of mounting psionic attacks that would leave humanoids paralyzed in fear—easy prey for the worms.</p><p>Gradually, a pattern emerged, whereby the psi-worms would leave small pockets of humanoids unmolested, but ferociously attack larger settlements, especially those that consumed the planet’s resources at an unsustainable rate. It became clear that the worms were acting as a defense mechanism for the planet itself, and that some kind of psionic super-consciousness was coordinating them, calling up swarms of worms whenever the environment was threatened.</p><p><em><strong>Fearless Drones</strong></em>. Psi-worms obey the commands of the collective instinctively and automatically. They have no capacity for independent thought and only behave with intelligence when formed into a gestalt. When psi-worms attack, they can’t be negotiated with, driven off, starved out, or forced to surrender—psi-worms will fight until one side is destroyed.</p><p><em><strong>Brain Burrowers</strong></em>. Humanoids that fall to psi-worms face a far more gruesome fate than death: as a psi-worm larvae burrows into its skull, it roots itself in the brain stem and seizes control of the creature, rendering them mindless. Until the threat has passed, these new worm walkers fight alongside the psi-worm gestalts to drive off invaders. However, when they are no longer needed, they are merely abandoned and left to fertilize the nearest patch of xenobloom.</p><h1>Replicators</h1><p>Replicators are autonomous, spaceborne constructs, designed with the singular, unthinking purpose of duplicating themselves as many times as possible. If allowed into a star system, a single replicator will soon multiply into an army, stripping asteroids bare, reducing planets to nothingness, and consuming entire moons. These constructs are a blight on the universe, a pestilence that devours everything it touches.</p><p><em><strong>Exponential Copies</strong></em>. Any machine that can replicate itself is perfectly exponential, provided its copies can collect enough raw material to continue reproducing. This mere fact has led to the utter annihilation of entire worlds, consumed by an endless tide of replicating machines who recursively stripped the world of all useful materials, destroying their creators in the process. Usually, these are isolated events; a disaster scenario that dooms an overly-ambitious civilization on one world, but when a replicating machine is built in space, it is an existential threat to all life in the galaxy.</p><p>Replicators are designed with the bare minimum to perform their operation: thrusters and power for movement, a laser and storage for mining, a simple sensor array, and processing equipment to extract useful ore. Individually, replicators aren't very intelligent or threatening; indeed, they're not even hostile, unless they detect useful materials. However, one always becomes many, and swarms of replicators are profoundly ruinous.</p><p><em><strong>Universal Quarantine</strong></em>. If a replicator is left unchecked, the only remaining recourse is a tactical arcane warhead strike. Even one replicator can repurpose the materials of its fallen brothers into a new swarm; nothing short of total annihilation can end it.</p><p>Should a warhead strike fail to destroy every replicator in the swarm, the affected star system is quarantined indefinitely—the swarm is left to devour it. These systems are deathtraps of hungry, slumbering constructs, awaiting new materials to consume.</p><p><em><strong>Sublight Expanse</strong></em>. Countless replicators surely drift through the Black even now, engaged in millennia long sublight journeys to new systems. A replicator can arrive to a system at any moment, and if not discovered in time, will spell doom to all worlds within it.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A replicator doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h3>World Engine</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.BBLWdvVKwxMcgV0E]{World Engine} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.yvNt5LvbTBXZ3nv8]{World Engine Swarm}</p><p>When a replicator is constructed on a world and allowed to improve itself, it nearly always results in an endless, exponential wave of world engines, land-based machines that convert every last scrap of raw material into more of their number. As apocalyptic as such an event might be, world engines are at least localized to a single world; they can't expand into the 'verse and seek to destroy far-off corners of the galaxy.</p><h3>Replicators</h3><p>(Missing Replicator pg. 233) @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.FOtzzz8VmboOcYGp]{Replicator Swarm} </p><p>A single replicator is far smaller than a normal ship, containing just enough equipment to process raw materials and fabricate each and every one of its own parts. If enough assemble to form a swarm, however, their destructive force is magnified, as the beams of a thousand replicators can reduce a warship into scrap metal with alarming speed.</p><h1>Scrap Golem</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.hA2EBFqs01hciHqF]{Scrap Golem}</p><p>A patchwork assortment of parts plodding about on mismatched legs, this construct is a true golem—a powerful, yet unwieldy one. Scrap golems are assembled from what's around: bits of metal, glass, plastic, clay, and wood, with critical components, like the construct core, scavenged or assembled to fit the shape and dimensions of the chassis. Unlike other golems, scrap golems don't have a manual or other guide; a skilled arcanist needs only excellent understanding of the fundamentals and a keen eye for useful scrap.</p><p><em><strong>Custom Build</strong></em>. Every scrap golem is unique, assembled with different weapons, materials, and functions in mind. These design variations are either prompted by necessity, when components are scarce, or by creativity, when the golem's creator decides to experiment with their designs. The result is a menagerie of mismatched golems, matching no other category than scrap.</p><p>Most scrap golems are stronger than their construct brethren in at least one respect, but are also based on deeply flawed designs. In designing golems, it seems that most arcanists are interested in optimizing one particular quality, such as the golem's agility, its strength, or its armor plating, to the detriment of all others. Perhaps, this is out of a narrow-minded attempt to create a superior golem, or perhaps, golem-makers are just obsessed with securing bragging rights over their contemporaries.</p><p><em><strong>Radiation Absorption</strong></em>. Scrap golems almost always have a special energy conversion matrix fitted to their construct cores. These utilize transmutation magic to convert radiant energy into power that the golem can use. As a result, engaging a scrap golem with standard blasters is extremely unwise, as this will simply supply it with a surplus of fuel for its own weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Software Bugs</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.oLzyUQL9zgAQ78dr]{Software Bug} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.Mr6iRu45dhIgk64c]{Bluescreen Swarm}</p><p>Software bugs are half-ethereal insects that nest within arcane terminals and ship computers, causing havoc for those who use them. These pests feed off of the power sources found within such devices and multiply rapidly when they find a steady food supply. Usually, a few software bugs can be found within any large computer system, but when these bugs become numerous enough to swarm, the best solution is usually to call a debugger, a special exterminator equipped for the task.</p><p><em><strong>Technological Immune System</strong></em>. Contrary to popular belief, a few software bugs can actually be beneficial. Software bugs safeguard data systems from harmful construct-specific diseases, such as the N-Virus, by causing small corruptions that keep viruses from taking hold. A well-placed bug can also stop a hacker dead in their tracks by creating logic flaws within their interface rig. In this way, the disruptions caused by a few software bugs are offset by the larger protections they provide.</p><p><em><strong>Bluescreen Swarms</strong></em>. Vast numbers of software bugs are a genuine hazard, though. In the bowels of supercomputers, or among large networks of arcane terminals, where data is exchanged rapidly, computer bugs can aggregate and multiply into bluescreen swarms, which not only bring down whatever computer system they hailed from, but also pose a serious danger to creatures nearby. Bluescreen swarms can ravage an entire ship, attacking anyone that so much as carries technology or approaches a terminal. Worse still, they can fully absorb the radiant energy of blaster bolts and emit the excess power as waves of harmful radiation.</p><h1>Songfish</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.BzL0xW4KM69tDsCJ]{Songfish}</p><p>Mysterious creatures intrinsically linked to the Void, songfish produce beautiful melodies and are considered good omens for travelers.</p><p><em><strong>Mostly Void, Partially Stars</strong></em>. These immense and rare creatures possess a silent, unearthly beauty that can leave one breathless. The songfish appears like a massive jellyfish, translucent and faintly glowing, filled with the inky black and glimmering lights of countless stars. The galaxies and nebulae seen through (or perhaps within) a songfish's body hail from distant and impossible reaches of space, for much like the Void itself, songfish are linked to the entire universe. If a songfish feels threatened, it can fold itself in space, vanishing and reappearing elsewhere in the cosmos. It's possible these fish are untethered by time as well—to date, no songfish that anyone can remember has been caught and closely examined.</p><p><em><strong>Melodies of Memory</strong></em>. There is no sound in space, yet a songfish projects a quiet, persistent refrain to all who see it. Somehow, this music is linked to memory, and all who listen to it recall a different song; always it is a distantly familiar harmony, a sublime and peaceful tune.</p><p><em><strong>Forgetters</strong></em>. Very few creatures hunt the songfish, for it is as rare as it is mesmerizing. But there are those who see this creature as a quarry to be hunted and a challenge to be overcome.</p><p>These hunters sometimes discover the songfish's defense mechanism: the songfish can manipulate the memory of every creature in the universe, erasing the essence of a creature, an object, or an entire ship. A thing that is erased by the songfish is not destroyed; rather, it is forgotten by all. Even evidence pertaining to a thing's existence is manipulated, shrouded in a mental fog. A creature's name might be stricken from existence, and their possessions are remembered instead as belonging to others or are compulsively ignored by everyone at once.</p><p>Moreover, the songfish can consume the memories of those which encounter it, causing a blanket amnesia in a massive field.</p><p>Very few creatures are aware of the songfish's amnesiac properties, perhaps not coincidentally. If one were to learn this information, it would surely be forgotten.</p><h1>Spaceshark</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“It's like a shark, but in space? Does anyone care to explain how this thing evolved? Can anyone even explain how it swims in space !?”</p><p>— Aleksei Lagunov V, perplexed human passenger, amidst a spaceshark attack</p></blockquote></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.a6EZmgNIOdZBBt4j]{Spaceshark}</p><p>Those who have an irrational fear of large sharks will find this fear is actually well-founded in space due to the spaceshark, a nimble apex-predator of the sea, but in space.</p><p><em><strong>Hungry for Steel</strong></em>. Spacesharks can digest almost anything, but the metal hulls of most starships are a particular delicacy to them. They can smell scrap metal for thousands of miles, and will try to bite even much larger ships, without fear or hesitation. Given a choice, however, a spaceshark is more likely to pick off a fighter\u0002sized or personal ship than a freighter.</p><p><em><strong>Pack Hunters</strong></em>. It is rare, but possible, for an entire school of spacesharks to form around places of abundant metal, such as some asteroid fields and the graveyards of derelict ships. When this happens, the sharks can hunt as an organized unit to bring down larger ships, gradually stripping them over a miles-long chase. The best way to avoid confrontation once a pack of spacesharks has your scent is to abandon a sizable amount of metal, like a fighter or a shuttle, to throw off your scent and stall for escape.</p><h1>Sporezerkers</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.E9eCWsvhs7PiiFlT]{Sporezerker} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.FG7yd8ID3MxDQStP]{Sporegantua}</p><p>Nothing in the 'verse is quite as savage, as ruthless, and as dimwitted as a sporezerker. Though they are lumbering, green bipeds, they have almost nothing in common with orcs; sporezerkers are green because they are actually an intelligent fungus.</p><p><em><strong>Fungal Conquerors</strong></em>. Sporezerkers are named for their infamous spores, which are fluffy, white, and capable of withstanding almost any temperature, from the vacuum of space to the heat of planetary reentry. If even a single spore lands on a fertile planet, it can quickly sprout into a horde of sporezerkers, ready to battle with anything they see. When slain, a sporezerker releases yet more spores, continuing the cycle anew. The only way to definitively stop a sporezerker is to burn it—its spores combust rather easily while still within a body.</p><p>As fungal creatures, sporezerkers have rudimentary brains; they know only to seek others and fight them. They lack the capacity for basic planning, but can learn simple facts when presented with them. For example, if one sporezerker watches another one burn after stepping into a fire or become decapitated after stepping into a trap, it will learn to avoid that obstacle and other obstacles that look like it.</p><p><em><strong>Swarm</strong></em>! Sporezerkers make up for their lack of insight or understanding with a very basic tactic: fight with overwhelming numbers. As long as spores can find water and soil, new sporezerkers will rise up to continue the fight—killing one only increases their numbers in the long run.</p><h3>Sporegantua</h3><p>Larger, and somehow ever dumber than the more common sporezerkers, sporegantua are formed when several sporezerkers sprout in a single fungal amalgamation. Its hands each terminate in several smaller fists and its face (if it can be called that) is a conglomeration of the vaguely goblinoid visages of its constituent sporezerkers. With some effort, the sporezerker can grow ever larger, unleashing a fury that can rip apart ships and crumble castle walls, but is just as likely to flatten several sporezerkers along the way.</p><h1>Thwirrel</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.ggFspAXywiCp1kTf]{Thwirrel}</p><p>Thwirrels are innately psionic, rodent-like creatures that infest ships, cities, and colonies around the galaxy, feeding on a mixture of magical energy and any food they can scavenge. Most spacers describe them as foot-long, furry creatures with ferret-like bodies, four rabbit-like ears, and long bushy tails. Not all spacers, however, notice them.</p><p><em><strong>Hidden Pests</strong></em>. Although thwirrels are common pests in nearly every spaceport in the galaxy, a surprisingly small number of people have ever seen one directly, owing to the thwirrels’ primary method of defense: thwirrels can use their native psionic abilities to effectively erase themselves from an observer’s senses. This isn't a form of invisibility, but rather a clever manipulation of the mind to hamper a predator’s ability to notice them. Because of this, a major thwirrel infestation can go unchecked for a very long time.</p><p>The most common sign of an infestation aboard a ship is a combination of missing food and sporadic power outages. Thwirrels are scavengers, stealing food wherever they can find it. These highly intelligent creatures will use teamwork to infiltrate cargo holds and unlock doors, all while avoiding detection using their psychic camouflage. Additionally, they feed on magical energy, chewing on the wires and conduits in a ship’s engine room or draining the arcane batteries of unattended blasters. It is thought that this diet of magical energy assists their telepathic powers.</p><p><em><strong>Prolific Breeders</strong></em>. When a small family of thwirrels comes across an abundant supply of food, they rapidly multiply, producing litters daily and exponentially growing in number. In this way, even two thwirrels hidden aboard a ship can migrate to a new colony and completely infest it. Therefore, the discovery of a thwirrel population is a time-sensitive crisis: if they aren't exterminated quickly, they’ll soon be impossible to stamp out.</p><h1>Tripod</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.SxAwfrPWl9EtKMtA]{Tripod}</p><p>The towering, enigmatic tripods which arrive from the stars are accompanied by a curious red moss, which spreads wherever they venture. Once a force of tripods lands, they set about indiscriminately exterminating all life they encounter in a bid to conquer the entire planet and claim its most precious resource: water.</p><p><em><strong>Machine Invaders</strong></em>. Clearly, the tripods are designed with alien and hostile intent, but beyond that, they are an enigma. Atop their three flexible legs—nearly 40 feet high—rests a domed chassis and menacing central eye, bright as a spotlight. This light is merely a precursor to the tripod's mounted laser cannon, which can reduce a man to ash in mere seconds. If an enemy wanders too close, the tripod can also produce a number of long tendrils to ensnare and capture its victim.</p><p>Within, their mechanics are incomprehensible—they have no guiding system remotely like a construct core; instead, every surface is covered with a thick layer of their red moss. Should the moss be critically poisoned, or the tripod be unable to refresh it with enough water, the tripod falls into a perpetually dormant state, to be awoken only by some later threat. By that strange metric, it seems almost reasonable to state that the moss is in fact controlling the tripods, if such a thing is truly possible.</p><p>Each tripod is capable of manufacturing more of its kind, producing them at a rate of about one tripod every seven days, provided it can find sufficient materials. After landing, a small number of tripods can quickly swell to an invading army of terrible power. However, tripods only seem to replicate once they have cleared enough room for the red moss to proliferate far ahead of them, and only pause to replicate if they have encountered stern resistance.</p><p><em><strong>Curious Red Moss</strong></em>. Damp, vascular, and fibrous, this crimson moss clings to every surface in the tripod's wake. It drinks deep of whatever water it encounters, spreading rapidly up riverbanks and along coastlines, choking other plants and vegetation with its roots. A single clump of red moss can transform a rainforest into a crimson jungle in a matter of hours.</p><p>As it spreads, the moss progressively alters the soil and atmosphere to favor its conditions for growth. It ejects sulfuric compounds into the air, soil, and water, inducing global changes with alarming speed. This terraforming is the final step for a tripod invasion. Once a planet has fully given way to its new atmosphere, a few tripods leave, flying aimlessly in search of new worlds, while the rest fall dormant, keeping a silent vigil over their conquered planet.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A tripod doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Var'zuul</h1><img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch07-varzuul.webp\" /><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.QfvjY2Hqipfo0445]{Var'zuul Grub} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.R6m49WU3nIUAZyX6]{Var'zuul Worm} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.wSrGj5PzLv54xL80]{Var'zuul Colossus}</p><p>These immense, wormlike creatures thrive out in the Black, feeding on a steady drip of radiation and the occasional hapless traveler. They range from vicious pests the size of a dog to colossal monstrosities capable of swallowing ships whole.</p><p><em><strong>From Grubs to Titans</strong></em>. The life cycle of var'zuul are a mystery to science, for they grow boundlessly, and never seem to age. This immortality is as much an enigma as it is a looming threat, for while young var'zuul are easy enough to deal with, legends speak of ancient worms wandering the Black, impossibly old and astoundingly large.</p><p>The odd traveler will tell tale of a void jump gone wrong, stranding their ship in the Black. While repairs are being made, the terrified crew watches the body of an immense var'zuul creep by, slowly blotting out a swath of stars behind its colossal frame. Before the worm notices the helpless ship, the crew manages to jump again. No one can speak to the veracity of these claims with any certainty, but it sends chills down the spine to consider that the Black may contain countless var'zuul, each large enough to consume a moon.</p><p><em><strong>Strange Anatomy</strong></em>. Var'zuul have a physiology completely unlike anything terrestrial life has ever created. Their long, slender bodies are actually boneless, supported by a network of flat, sinuous bands that twist helically to contract, and unwind to relax. These bands give the worms their unsettling motion, but it is the strange, luminescent fluid contained in pustules throughout the body that somehow lets the var'zuul slither though empty space like water. This fluid resists motion in space, as if it pulls against an unseen force when it is moved, but loses this property shortly after the worm dies. The underlying physics (or magic) behind this phenomenon is baffling to science.</p><p>Moreover, var'zuul are capable of digesting almost any living matter, but are also capable of subsisting on the radiation prevalent in empty space. This method of digestion, too, seems to have to deal with the luminescent fluid within var'zuul bodies.</p><h1>Vortirrackt</h1><img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch07-vortirrackt.webp\" style=\"float:right;width:250px\" /><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.RK5TRCEyv57vhrOj]{Vortirrackt Larva} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.0fCyGyxvgNIeITWw]{Vortirrackt} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.sqS4zR4sWfEZwxw6]{Vortirrackt Chrysalis} @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.PT932v4XtJ3ws0UP]{Demi-Vortirrackt}</p><p>The vortirrackt are abominable predators hailing from the far edge of the multiverse. They have pale, slimy skin, resistant to weapons, a pointed head terminating in rows of razor-sharp teeth, and six sickeningly long limbs, each with one joint more than a terrestrial creature and clawlike fingers at the end. Worse yet, these creatures are no mere beasts, as their frightful intellect demonstrates.</p><p><em><strong>Out of the Dimensional Pit</strong></em>. The multiverse is crisscrossed by a series of dimensional pits, tunnels which snake their way through the dimensions by weaving tight circuits around the Void. Few creatures will even approach them, for their radiation can penetrate even through shielded ships. However, the vortirrackt can slink through the pits with ease, and follow them wherever they open in the multiverse—each pit a new hunting ground.</p><p>Vortirrackt, telepathic as they are, do not crowd one another. If a pit opens where there is little prey, only one beast stalks through, but if prey is abundant, two or three might hunt in a small pack.</p><p><em><strong>Insidious Hunters</strong></em>. Vortirrackt are as ferocious as they are cunning, and will happily litter their accommodations with perilous traps to ensnare intelligent prey. Let loose for twenty-four hours on a spacecraft, a vortirracktwill convert it into a veritable dungeon of deathtraps, interwoven with passageways through air vents and conduits for the monster itself.</p><p>One by one, it slaughters and devours those in its domain, all the while tormenting them with telepathy. The creature will learn the names of its prey, their specialties, and what best to say to mock them. This doesn't seem to be for any tactical advantage; the monster just finds its food all the more delicious when it gets to know it first.</p><p><em><strong>Convoluted Metamorphosis</strong></em>. The vortirrackt have a unique biological cycle, beginning reproduction by releasing parasitic worms. These worms mature in the wombs or eggs of other creatures until they develop into larvae large enough to burst through their container. A still-growing larva then spins itself into a chrysalis, inside which it continues maturing into a demi-vortirrackt. The whole process takes only a few days.</p><p>Strangely, the demi-vortirrackt is larger and more aggressive than its elders, but possesses none of their cunning or telepathy. Within a few weeks, it sheds its brown, muscular outer skin and emerges as a smaller, pale-skinned adult vortirrackt.</p><h1>W'rnoctur</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“If you feel a trembling beneath your feet, drop your canteens and scatter.”</p><p>— Ethel Arcadien, near-human explorer</p></blockquote></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.kuzzp8csWb0obcSu]{W'rnoctur}</p><p>The fearsome w'rnoctur worms slumber beneath the sands of thousands of desert worlds, waiting for unwary prey to disrupt the dunes above. It's unclear how such a ubiquitous predator spread to so many worlds in the first place, but any world with vast expanses of sand is feared to contain at least one pair of w'rnocturs.</p><p><em><strong>Desert Legends</strong></em>. Nothing is more dreaded in the wastelands than a w'rnoctur striking from beneath. Death is almost instant to any unfortunate individual ambushed by a w'rnoctur, and the strike isn't soon forgotten by survivors. As such, the worms have become legendary throughout the 'verse as a nearly omnipresent threat on sandy worlds. Such a reputation has a pinch of exaggeration, however: though w'rnocturs are common, they are perhaps only found on half of all desert worlds.</p><p><em><strong>Pair Predators</strong></em>. W'rnocturs mate for life and are almost always found hunting in pairs. In the terrifying circumstance that a massive w'rnoctur explodes from the sand, travelers should yet be wary: another monstrosity is not far behind.</p><p>Female w'rnocturs are larger, and carry with them a large clutch of eggs, which mature over the course of decades. It's unknown how long the worms live individually, but if their egg's development is anything to go by, adult w'rnocturs may very well be ancient.</p><p><em><strong>Moisture Hunters</strong></em>. W'rnocturs live deep underneath the sand, emerging only to hunt, and always strike with uncanny accuracy. How the w'rnocturs detect their prey was long a topic of debate until amoeboid researchers discovered that w'rnoctur sense organs detect the moisture of other living beings; thus, constructs are practically invisible to them, as long as they remain dry and carry no potions. Other living things can only tread lightly on the dunes and hope that the worms are soundly asleep in hibernation.</p><h1>Wandering Rift</h1><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.vrMIWTWyjaWifePe]{Wandering Rift}</p><p>Sometimes when a tremendous void crystal is shattered, or some other catastrophic event releases an immense amount of exotic energy, a persistent hole is ripped into the Void. Such a tear in space behaves much like a portal created momentarily by a Dark Matter engine, but with a much more violent gravitational pull and a corona of dangerous radiation that makes approaching it a treacherous maneuver. Occasionally, through some dark magic or planar interference, these rifts can acquire sentience, becoming what can be best described as massive, intelligent voids.</p><p><em><strong>Ravenous Maws</strong></em>. Wandering rifts are driven by a ravenous hunger to consume all things. Slowly, they prowl the Black, obliterating everything in their paths. When they encounter moving prey, they project beams of radiation to incapacitate their target, before drawing them into their swirling, stormlike maws, where they are compacted into nothingness in an instant. Fortunately, wandering rifts move very haltingly, so a rift generated deep in the Black could take eons to reach anything of importance.</p><p><em><strong>Gravity Seekers</strong></em>. Curiously, all recorded instances of wandering rifts have been noted to pursue the strongest and closest gravitational pull, hesitating only to hunt ships and creatures that wander too near. This means that, though nearby systems might momentarily distract them, all wandering rifts are slowly converging on the center of the galaxy.</p><p><em><strong>Elemental Nature</strong></em>. A wandering rift doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Wizmos</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Wizmo Imprint</h4><p>A mob of wizmos can decide that someone would make a suitable master for any reason and will imprint upon them after a long moment of entranced admiration. This individual becomes the wizmos' master.</p><p>Once a mob has imprinted on a master, it is extraordinarily difficult to escape them. Wizmos are designed by the fey and therefore know a number of convoluted ways to slip between the planes and return to their master's side, appearing the instant their master thinks they are at last alone. If their master leaves the wizmos behind, even if their master is on another plane of existence, the wizmos will appear nearby their master after one minute, unless doing so would place them in grave danger.</p><p>A mob of wizmos will accept general commands (such as to guard a corridor or retrieve an item) issued by their master as a bonus action, but will not necessarily enact them. When such a command is given, roll a d20. On a roll of 14 or higher, the wizmos obey the command to the best of their ability. On a roll of 6 or lower, the wizmos fail to obey the command whatsoever, and instead do something totally unrelated to the command. On a roll of 7 to 13, the wizmos attempt to obey the command, but get confused and do something similar to the command. For example, if a mob of wizmos is tasked to retrieve a concussion grenade, they might instead return with a fruit of similar dimensions, or they might return with the grenade, without its pin, moments from detonating.</p><p>A mob of wizmos in service of a master will repair itself each day at dawn, restoring all its lost hit points.</p><p>Though they are quick to forgive their master's rudeness and indiscretions (as well as the behavior of their master's allies), the wizmos will leave and never return if their master or their allies attack them.</p></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.LvkKTSBEKtxhReBg]{Wizmo}@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.r2VhvKDGRgyg0x0g]{Wizmo Mob}</p><p> Energetic and capricious, wizmos are little constructs manufactured by a fey lord to spread disorder and whimsy throughout the mortal realm. Each wizmo is utterly unique, but all wizmos love to get into trouble, conduct elaborate pranks, annoy polite company, and cause minor property damage. Moreover, they do all of these things best when assembled into a little mob.</p><p><em><strong>Mobs of Mischief Makers</strong></em>. Though wizmos are experts in all manner of pranks and shenanigans, the chaos caused by a mob of wizmos depends largely upon the group's size. A few wizmos might get away with petty theft, graffiti, pushing random buttons on arcane terminals, and rearranging furniture, while larger groups will tend towards lighting things on fire, throwing trash in Dark Matter engines, replacing blasters with bananas (and vice-versa), and kidnapping (though the victim is usually released quickly).</p><p>Though wizmos aren't clever individually, they're practically devious in a mob. Wizmos communicate with rapid chirps of beeps and boops, such that a whole mob of wizmos sounds like a chittering buzz. This racket is how the wizmos form a swarm intelligence: their noisy shouting matches amount to their construct brains reasoning out complicated problems together. The larger the mob and the louder the racket, the longer a mob's attention span and the more elaborate their pranks.</p><p><em><strong>Master Seekers</strong></em>. When wizmos aren't vandalizing property, stealing things, or upsetting small animals, they are passively searching for a master to guide them. Perhaps their need to find a master traces back to their fey creator, or perhaps they were simply designed that way to more persistently annoy one individual at a time.</p><p>Regardless, once a group of wizmos imprint on an individual they deem suitable, they are quite inseparable. They'll follow their master anywhere, whether or not their master wants them at their side, and they'll even heed commands, to an extent (though their execution of said commands is bumbling at best). In the best case, their chaotic tendencies might be focused on something productive, but in the worst case, they'll drive their master mad before moving on and finding another one.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Nature</strong></em>. A wizmo doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><h1>Wroth</h1><p>Across the galaxy, these words are spoken in whispers, with fearful glances to the night sky:</p><blockquote><section id=\"secret-uiTCVTtZmH9IkjlH\" class=\"secret\"><p>“Beware the wroth, that scourge, that utter evil that dwells in the Black. For by night, they descend in their stygian ships to steal away children, to slaughter entire villages, to desecrate our lands, only to vanish before sunrise.”</p></section></blockquote><p><em><strong>Takers from the Black</strong></em>. Few understand anything truly concrete about the wroth, save for the terror of their enigmatic machines, their unrestrained cruelty, and their appetite for stealing away intelligent beings.</p><p>Wrothian ships are powerful, though not unassailable; however, their raids rarely meet organized resistance. Once the wroth land, they converge on a settlement with a force of takers and collector vats, overseen by a wrothian alpha or a primarch, and begin stealing away as many humanoids as possible. Then, they vanish just as quickly as they arrived, retreating untraceably with their prisoners into the Black. No one taken ever returns.</p><p><em><strong>The Perfect</strong></em>. Wrothians consider themselves the pinnacle of life in the universe, for constructing even a single wrothian taker requires the sacrifice of hundreds of lesser humanoid lives; constructing a primarch requires thousands. For this reason, wrothians believe themselves to be perfect—no other lifeform is comparable. Whereas other races wither and die with age, the wroth live indefinitely. Whereas other races have feeble minds, wrothian primarchs possess vast intellects and psionic power. Whereas other races rely on the crutch of green planets and their resources, the wroth persist in the endless Black.</p><p>The fuel of their grim life cycle begins at processing other organisms. When they land to abduct humanoids, the captives are thrust into collector vats, where their skin, muscle, and bones are gradually but methodically digested into a rich ooze of bio-matter. The brains and nerves are horrifically untouched by this process, and are instead preserved in jars, to be tormented indefinitely for psionic power. The bio-matter of hundreds or thousands is returned to the ship, where an advanced creation matrix weaves together the molecules of a new, perfect organism.</p><p>These details, as well as the fact that wrothians are nourished by the constant hum of psionic energy on their ships, is wholly unknown to most. The vast majority of the galaxy only understands the horrors of wrothian arrival and the loss felt by those taken.</p><h3>Wrothian Failure</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.wiDKZDsEdia72dOB]{Wrothian Failure}</p><p>When a wrothian creation matrix is flush with biomass and fully powered, it leaves no imperfections in its creations; however, when short on time or materials, it sometimes creates outright abominations. Wrothian failures are the genetic outcasts left over when this process goes horribly wrong, resulting in hideous beast-like creatures which scramble about on four legs and hunger for fresh meat.</p><p>Instead of exterminating these creatures, the primarchs have chosen to utilize them, releasing them as expendable shock troopers during their raids. Indeed, because they require so little biomass to create, the primarchs will sometimes create a pack of failures specifically to wreak havoc as they reap more populous settlements.</p><h3>Wrothian Taker</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.t5KBEGvSjR2ACNnD]{Wrothian Taker}</p><p>Wrothian takers are bred by the dozen to scour planets for new captives, and are as vicious as they are clever. Deep in their minds, they contain the spark of psionic potential, but sadly, their creation falls short; only the primarchs are truly perfect. Takers violently rip through settlements, capturing the weak and delivering them to collection pods. If a taker lives to its life's potential, it harvests enough humanoids to create a single primarch.</p><h3>Wrothian Alpha</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.sViPGQ1G6V3j221y]{Wrothian Alpha}</p><p>Created to oversee raids in the primarchs' stead, the wrothian alphas are larger, more aggressive versions of takers, which stand nearly a foot taller and wield substantial psionic power. Alphas are still strictly second to the primarchs in all respects, but are allowed a degree of free thought that takers are rarely afforded. Such independence is necessary to strategize offworld, of course, but also ensures that alphas pledge their undying loyalty to the primarchs by choice, rather than by psionic demand.</p><h3>Wrothian Primarch</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.T5IMrZcOhL23cbCB]{Wrothian Primarch}</p><p>Vile, scheming, and wholly malevolent, wrothian primarchs are formidable psions of unmatched strength. They possess a vast but cryptic intellect of mysterious motivations and complex schemes which drives their every action. At a primarch's word, their ships descend from the Black upon undefended worlds and prisoners are taken to fuel their dark ambitions. Only in dire times do primarchs venture to the surface to command their forces directly; their psionic link is strong enough to possess their takers and failures from hundreds of miles away.</p><h1>Xenobloom</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“As we took off, I saw the whole surface of the planet—that awful magenta fungus everywhere— reaching out like a grasping hand to pull us down.”</p><p>— Castreek, human sorcerer, on his escape from the planet Kiron</p></blockquote></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.8D7PVMF3AZMVu8iH]{Xenobloom}</p><p>Living symbiotically alongside psi-worms wherever they are found is a species of massive, magenta fungus known as xenobloom. The fungus forms dense, thorny forests and quickly grows back when cut down, so it presents a fearsome barrier to colonists and a thriving home to psi-worms. Consequently, settlements established on xenobloom-infested planets are typically built in areas where the fungus is most sparse, though this does little to stave off the fungi’s ire in the long term.</p><p><em><strong>Worm Shelters</strong></em>. Xenoblooms provide more than just physical shelter to psi-worms: they are also excellent hiding places. It isn't uncommon for humanoids trespassing in xenobloom-dominated regions to be ambushed by swarms of worms, from which only the most vigilant explorers tend to return.</p><p><em><strong>Psionic Fungus</strong></em>. Xenoblooms also appear to be sentient, capable of defending themselves with lashing tendrils and engaging in sudden, explosive growth spurts to engulf would-be attackers.</p><p>Although the fungus has no psionic powers of its own, it has been observed to emit a psionic field that augments the powers of nearby psi-worms. It has been suggested that the xenoblooms form a planet-spanning psychic network that enables the psi-worms to communicate with each other, though the implications of such a thing are surely too terrifying to contemplate.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.cFgbCXTJNfN81nm3"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bjgntohdazs"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668550107246,"modifiedTime":1670445873407,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"OFkYYZZO6To2AQGR"}

There are many who believe that the old weapons are more elegant or civilized, while others maintain that a simple blaster is reliable enough for almost any engagement. As a result, axes, blasters, bows, and energy blades crisscross the 'verse—a culmination of eras and fighting styles all contending in combat.</p><p>This section introduces a few of the high technology options available to players, including blasters and laser swords. All of the following weapons except for the skathári warclub and wrenchinator count as magical technology.</p><h1>Blasters</h1><p>Blasters are arcane weapons that eschew traditional projectiles in favor of energetic pulses, powered by arcane batteries and focused through specialized apertures. Because they self-recharge, blasters need not ever be reloaded, even though some are prone to overheating.</p><h3>Damage Rolls with Blasters</h3><p>Unlike other weapons, you don't add your ability modifier to the damage roll of a blaster unless otherwise stated.</p><h3>Two-Weapon Fighting with Blasters</h3><p>Unlike other ranged weapons, you can engage in two\u0002weapon fighting with two light blasters. When you do so, you subtract 2 from the damage roll of the bonus attack, to a minimum of 1 damage.</p><h1>Melee Weapons</h1><p>Many in the 'verse, including quite experienced spacers, prefer the reliability of a sword or the heft of an axe. After all, for all their dazzle, blasters and energy weapons are fallible: they can malfunction, be disabled by Dead Magic Zones, and simply fall to pieces. None of these apply to good old-fashioned weapons. As such, every weapon in the SRD has a place in <em>Dark Matter</em>.</p><p>Of course, even among those who would eschew a blaster in favor of a close-quarters weapon, there are many who prefer high-tech options. The laser sword is an extremely popular choice with everyone from backwater hermits to trained sepulcher knights, as it combines the traditionalism of a steel sword with the advantages of modern technology. Most high-tech melee weapons in Dark Matter share a similar appeal, since exotic materials and fixed-length energy blades have novel properties not found elsewhere.</p><p>Other weapons, such as the plasma cutter, thermal lance, and wrenchinator, are more tools than weapons, but have become a favorite with spacers everywhere, due in part to their availability, and part to their brutal effectiveness.</p><h1>Weapon Descriptions</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Gnomish Blasters</h4><p>In the extensive Dead Magic Zones prevalent throughout the 'verse, gnomes have thrived using blasters powered by technological means, rather than magical ones. In fact, nearly all of gnomish technology forgoes magic in favor of their strange and complex technologies, for gnomish science sees itself as equal to all arcana.</p><p>A gnomish blaster is functionally much the same as an ordinary one, but costs twice as much, deals force damage instead of the blaster's normal damage type, and functions normally in Dead Magic Zones.</p><p>Gnomish technology still counts as magical technology for the purposes of spells and magical effects that influence such technology.</p></div><p>These weapons might be found on a starship, in storage lockers aboard the Solar Citadel, or scattered across a battle-scarred moon.</p><p><em><strong>Antimatter Dagger.</strong></em> Favored by assassins and infiltrators, the antimatter dagger produces a short blade of crackling energy. With some skill, this weapon can be hidden up a sleeve, stashed in a belt, or secreted away in a hidden compartment, to be revealed at the right moment for a precision kill.</p><p><em><strong>Antimatter Carbine.</strong></em> A more versatile model of the standard carbine, this antimatter-firing weapon has a collapsible stock and a shortened muzzle, so it can be used in any environment.</p><p><em><strong>Arc Baton.</strong></em> The weighted end of this steel baton contains a trio of crackling electrodes which send a surge of electricity through any creature they touch.</p><p><em><strong>Avia-Ra Sunstaff.</strong></em> This long staff, forked at its end near a prominent gemstone, is a blaster in its own right. When used in expert hands, the sunstaff can bludgeon, trip, and strike foes as a quarterstaff, only to be squeezed in both hands to fire a burst of hot plasma seconds later.</p><p><em><strong>Ballistic Gloves.</strong></em> These gloves feature a cylindrical grip in the palms, which strengthens the fists and charges a set of knuckle-mounted thunder cells. On a strike, the gloves magnify kinetic energy at the knuckles and issue a deafening crack.</p><p><em><strong>Battlefist.</strong></em> A mechanical, articulating gauntlet, this weapon slips over a hand and mimics its movements. A battlefist can deliver crushing blows on its own, but is usually paired with another weapon, such as a blaster, to be employed when enemies draw too near. This weapon is especially favored by the vect, who can integrate one in place of a hand to ensure a weapon is always nearby.</p><p><em><strong>Blitz Cannon.</strong></em> With its imposing rectangular muzzle, this brutalist weapon has a clear right and wrong end to be on. Pulling its trigger unleashes a torrent of lightning bolts in a wide, imprecise spray, making it extremely dangerous at point-blank range.</p><p><em><strong>Concussion Rifle.</strong></em> A series of arcane capacitors run the length of this rifle, terminating in a thick condenser that compresses its blast into a precise burst. A concussion rifle is especially deadly at long ranges, and its damage bypasses most energetically-resistant armor.</p><p><em><strong>Crystalline Rod.</strong></em> The strange, two-foot long rod wielded by wrothians is composed of a glistening, exotic crystal which pulls against an underlying field in the universe. Moving it around reveals a strange resistance, as any speed, an invisible wave of force extends feet from the rod, bashing any obstacles in front of it.</p><p><em><strong>Diode Beam.</strong></em> A scaled-down version of a pulse cannon, the diode beam is best used as a mounted weapon. Though it can be fired in accurate pulses, it's also possible to lock the weapon's fire mode, creating a continuous stream of deadly energy.</p><p><em><strong>Ion Cannon.</strong></em> The ion cannon always fires in a bright, diffuse cone, making it far deadlier up close. Between shots, it always makes a quiet zipping noise, as the arcane battery charges the ion cell for another blast.</p><p><em><strong>Laser Claws.</strong></em> When activated, these gloves project dazzling, razor-sharp claws from the fingertips, which can be used to shred a foe to ribbons.</p><p><em><strong>Laser Halfsword.</strong></em> This laser sword of shorter hilt and half-blade length is normally wielded in pairs, making a light complement for deft two-weapon fighters.</p><p><em><strong>Laser Sword.</strong></em> An elegant weapon, for a more enlightened age, the laser sword consists of a metal hilt which projects a fixed-length laser when activated. Its weightless blade makes for an agile, deadly weapon capable of cutting through many materials. The sword could even stop a blaster bolt, but alas, one would need precognition and superhuman reflexes to do so.</p><p><em><strong>Magnus.</strong></em> This impressive handgun, named for its creator, Magnus Opum, weighs almost twice that of a repeater. It’s infamous for its heft, recoil, and stopping\u0002power, and it is favored by gunslingers that accept no compromises.</p><p><em><strong>Phaser.</strong></em> Phasers aren't designed for effectiveness so much as portability and non-lethality. These blasters are often issued to peace-keepers and emissaries that require personal defense but have no intent to kill others.</p><p><em><strong>Photonic Lash.</strong></em> A wicked weapon favored by the elves, the photonic lash produces a bright tendril of energy from its metal hilt. The lash leaves painful, burning lacerations on its victims, along with lasting scars—a tell-tale sign that one has defied the whims of the high elves.</p><p><em><strong>Plasma Cutter.</strong></em> Few things are as intimidating as a plasma cutter’s circular, white-hot blade. When used in normal operation to carve up high-density metal plates, it can easily remove careless fingers or limbs, but if wielded with lethal intent, it can cleanly dissect someone from end to end.</p><p><em><strong>Plasma Launcher.</strong></em> This short tube launches an orb of superheated plasma in an arc. On contact, the plasma explodes, popping like a balloon in a dazzling fireball of sparks and expanding gas.</p><p><em><strong>Psionic Helm.</strong></em> The nodes mounted on this helmet’s dome emit an invisible psionic field, amplified by the mind of anyone who wears it. By focusing on the helm and extending a hand, the user can even direct the field into a blast of psionic force.</p><p><em><strong>REC Gun.</strong></em> The Revolving Exothermic Cannon (or REC gun, for short) operates on the same principle as a conventional blaster, with an arcane battery hooked up to an aperture barrel and so forth, but mounts several blasters on a revolving cylinder, each firing in rapid succession.</p><p><em><strong>Repeater.</strong></em> The quintessential handheld blaster, the repeater is a staple on the Galactic Frontier. Solid, reliable, and packing just enough firepower to bring down an assailant, nearly every explorer worth their salt has one of these strapped to their hip.</p><p><em><strong>Repulsor Gauntlet.</strong></em> Similar to a battlefist, but larger in scale, this hulking gauntlet invariably throws its users off-balance. Concealed within it is an arcane battery from a blaster, which the gauntlet channels into the knuckles to augment its blows with layered forcefields.</p><p><em><strong>Rocket Hammer.</strong></em> Only the dwarves would conceive of a weapon so unwieldy as the rocket hammer. As its name implies, it is very much a conventional warhammer with a rocket thruster built into the head to magnify its bludgeoning potential.</p><p><em><strong>Singularity Emitter.</strong></em> Less a blaster in the conventional sense, and more a stripped-down Dark Matter engine designed to rip a contained hole in the universe, the singularity emitter is a singularly destructive weapon. After being fired, however, the weapon must cool down, venting exceptional amounts of heat to maintain a stable Dark Matter core.</p><p><em><strong>Skathári Warclub.</strong></em> True to their nature, skathári warriors prefer simple, straightforward weapons, such as their traditional warclubs. These clubs are fitted with a row of large spikes for punching through invertebrate shells and discouraging huge predators.</p><p><em><strong>Standard Carbine.</strong></em> As its name might suggest, the standard carbine is the standard-issue blaster for all Hegemony and Coalition troops, which by default makes it one of the most pervasive weapons in the galaxy. Some soldiers praise the weapon's accuracy and durability, while others decry its difficult-to-control automatic fire; on the battlefield, however, there's no questioning this weapon's efficacy.</p><p><em><strong>Swarm Pistol.</strong></em> This handheld blaster, styled much like a repeater, has a wickedly fast automatic fire, capable of spewing dozens of rays in seconds. The most dexterous users might even find it possible to use one in each hand.</p><p><em><strong>Thermal Lance.</strong></em> When a button on this metal tube is pressed, a persistent, foot-long blue stream of flame erupts from its end, scorching those it touches. Though this tool was fashioned for mining asteroids for precious minerals, it has become a favorite (albeit eccentric) choice of weapon for avia-ra warriors.</p><p><em><strong>Wrenchinator.</strong></em> Though different models exist, the most common by far is the Wrenchinator 9000, a tool used by starship mechanics the ‘verse over. This incredible oversized wrench can fasten bolts, loosen bolts, and clobber people over the head.</p><p><em><strong>Void Shackles.</strong></em> These heavy wristbands wither at the space in front of its user's fists, creating microscopic holes to the Void that tear into the target.</p><p><em><strong>Volcanic.</strong></em> The flame-throwing volcanic consists of a set of tanks and a hefty arcane battery arranged into a backpack, connected by a hose to the gun. The gun itself is essentially a nozzle and trigger for the weapon's volatile incendiary spray, which chars any organic target in seconds.</p><h1>Weapon Properties</h1><p>As shown in the Weapons table, weapons in Dark Matter share a number of special properties:</p><p><em><strong>Automatic.</strong></em> When you make an attack with this weapon on your turn, you can choose to make two attacks with disadvantage instead. These attacks always have disadvantage, regardless of circumstance.</p><p><em><strong>Blaster.</strong></em> A weapon with the Blaster property is a ranged weapon that requires no ammunition. Blasters are considered firearms for the purpose of class features and abilities. Like firearms, you don’t add your ability score modifier to blasters’ damage rolls.</p><p>Explosive. When this weapon’s projectile hits a target, it explodes in a 5-foot radius. The projectile can be fired at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save or no damage on a successful one. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Fist. Attacks made with this weapon are treated as unarmed strikes. Foregrip. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. If used in two hands, its normal range increases by 50 feet and its long range increases by 200 feet. Heat. This weapon gains a heat point whenever an attack is made with it and loses one heat point whenever you begin your turn. If the weapon gains 3 heat points, it overheats and loses all heat points. An overheated weapon can't be used to make an attack again until the end of your next turn. Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Mounted. This weapon is normally used while attached to a tripod, vehicle, or other bracing mount. You can mount or unmount this weapon as an action. While it is mounted, it can't be moved. It can only be used to make an attack while unmounted if held by a Medium or larger creature with a Strength score of at least 15. Nonlethal. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, you can choose to knock the creature out, rendering it unconscious, rather than deal a killing blow. Overheat. Once you make an attack with this weapon, it can't be used again to make an attack until the end of your next turn. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. Scatter. If you make an attack against a target that is within half this weapon’s normal range, you deal the damage value listed in parentheses instead of the weapon’s normal damage dice. Sighted. This weapon has disadvantage on attack rolls made against targets within 20 feet. Special. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons”).</p><p><em><strong>Two-Handed.</strong></em> This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><p><em><strong>Versatile.</strong></em> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><h1>Special Weapons</h1><p>Weapons with special properties are described here.</p><p><em><strong>Avia-Ra Sunstaff.</strong></em> This weapon can also be used as a quarterstaff. Arc Baton. When a creature is hit with this weapon, it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Battlefist.</strong></em> This weapon acts as an oversized, articulated gauntlet. It can hold and manipulate objects, though you can’t attack with your battlefist while you’re holding an object with it.</p><p><em><strong>Diode Beam.</strong></em> As an action, this weapon can be fired continuously in a beam, affecting a 120-foot long, 5-foot wide line in a direction you choose. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 radiant damage.</p><p>At the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, roll a d20. On a 5 or lower, the weapon overheats and can’t be fired until the end of your next turn. If you roll higher than 5, you can use your action to continue firing the beam and can change the direction the line faces from you.</p><p><em><strong>Laser Sword.</strong></em> Depending on this weapon’s construction, it can deal force, necrotic, or radiant damage. Once the weapon is created, this damage type doesn't change.</p><p><em><strong>Plasma Cutter.</strong></em> This weapon ignores the damage threshold of nonmagical objects that it cuts.</p><p><em><strong>Psionic Helm.</strong></em> You can use your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, instead of Dexterity, for this weapon’s attack rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Rocket Hammer.</strong></em> Once per turn, when you make an attack with this weapon, you can engage its thrusters to deal an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.</p><p><em><strong>Singularity Emitter.</strong></em> When this weapon hits a target, each creature within 10 feet of the target is pulled up to 5 feet toward it.</p><p><em><strong>Volcanic.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack with this weapon, it spews flames in a 15-foot radius cone. Each creature within that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Armor","type":"text","_id":"DB7nbrhnULECyxSj","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Calculating AC</h4><p>Some class features (such as the Gadgeteer's Experimental Frame) and equipment (such as the Spiked Plating construct graft) give you a different way to calculate your AC.

Practical technology might not be the most glamorous, but it’s certainly indispensable: no ship could travel far in the ‘verse without functioning life suits, and explorers would literally be in the dark without flashlights. Of course, adventurers and explorers still make use of conventional gear, much of which has evolved with the march of progress: healer’s kits, locks, and manacles have all changed considerably, but they still serve the same purpose. Other things, like backpacks, have hardly changed at all.</p><p>The following devices are considered magical technology: bottled lightning, comm sets, concussion grenades, datapads, flashlights, holo-spheres, igniters, interface rigs, life suits, log keepers, quadcorders, and wristwatches.

It can hold 10 pounds of gear.</p><p><em><strong>Binoculars.</strong></em> Objects viewed through binoculars are magnified to ten times their size.</p><p>Bottled Lightning. This glass canister is filled with a constantly surging bolt of magic lightning and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 10 feet. As an action, you can throw this canister up to 20 feet, breaking it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the bottled lightning as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage. Comm Set. Using this handheld device, you can verbally communicate with any creature within 1 mile that also has a comm set. A comm set can be connected to a headset worn on the ear or can be talked into directly. Its signal can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. Concussion Grenade. This spherical device, dotted with blinking lights, explodes in a wave of concussive force. As an action, you can throw this grenade up to 20 feet, which detonates a moment after impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the grenade as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage and is deafened until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or also take this damage and be deafened for the same duration. Data Book. This 10-inch long rectangular drive can hold a massive quantity of information—ten times as much as a datapad can hold. Over the course of a minute, you can transfer information between a data book and an arcane terminal, a datapad, or ship’s computer, uploading or downloading any information you have access to, but information can't be directly read from a data book. Like a datapad, a data book can be locked with a secret password. Datapad. A common gadget that is used to store personal information, search for data on arcane terminals, communicate with others, and transfer credits. You can enter text by hand into a datapad or draw in it using a stylus as if it were a notebook with 2,000 pages. You can also search these notes with one-word queries. If the datapad is within 1 mile of an arcane terminal or ship's computer, you can use it to communicate with other datapads that are also within that range, provided both datapads have exchanged a comm number. This communication is limited to one text-based message (128 characters) every minute. Lastly, datapads are often used to access an account with the Galactic Bank, where your wealth is stored as credits on their server. When you get a datapad, you also lock it with a password that you likely keep secret. Only someone with the password can access the datapad (barring unauthorized access, which can be accomplished with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Data) check to hack the datapad). If the datapad is connected by cable to an arcane terminal or ship's computer, you can use it to perform advanced operations on systems connected to it. This might be necessary to operate some systems, like the research devices on a science satellite. Flare. A flare is a foot-long, brightly colored stick with a plastic cap. You can strike the bottom of the flare as an action, causing the flare to bursts into a bright, colored flame, matching that of the stick. This flame burns for 10 minutes, emitting a 40-foot radius of bright light and dim light for an additional 20 feet. A flare will still burn underwater or in a vacuum. Flashlight. This device produces a 60-foot cone of bright light, and dim light for an additional 15 feet. It can provide light for up to 4 hours, after which it must recharge for 8 hours.</p><p><em><strong>Holo-Sphere.</strong></em> As an action, you can activate this 6-inch wide sphere and deploy it within 15 feet of you. The sphere then captures a 5-foot cube holographic recording of the events of the next 30 seconds, which can be replayed on it later. In spite of the high technology, the image leaves something to be desired: the sphere produces a roughly one-foot high monochromatic hologram of the subject it recorded, often with a considerable amount of static. High volumes of magic disrupt recording with even more static, often creating an unrecognizable holographic mess. Holster. A holster is a specially-made holder which allows a blaster which lacks the Two-Handed property to be carried on a belt or under the arm. Hypodermic Needle. This syringe can directly inject a substance into someone’s bloodstream. You can load a liquid, such as a potion of healing, into a hypodermic needle as a bonus action, then administer it to another creature as an action on your turn. If the creature is unwilling, you must make a melee weapon attack, treating the needle as an improvised weapon, to do so. Interface Rig. An interface rig includes everything necessary to connect to a device without an accessible interface: a datapad accessor loaded with complicated algorithms, a plethora of wires and connectors, and a heavy magnet, in case things get dire. Such a rig is necessary to gain unauthorized access to many systems. Krash. When you drink this can of sugary liquid as an action, you feel a rush of energy. For the next hour, your exhaustion level temporarily decreases by 1. You can only be under the effect of one can of krash at a time. Life Suit. This one-piece jumpsuit comes equipped with a domed glass helmet. While wearing it, you can breathe normally and survive underwater or in the vacuum of space without ill effect for up to 24 hours at a time. The suit must be removed for 2 hours to replenish its air supply. While wearing it, you are immune to the effects of inhaled poisons, gases, and pathogens. Additionally, the suit insulates you from extreme environmental temperatures (see Appendix E). You can wear the suit under armor. Log Keeper. This foot-long device records and replays audio, organizing entries by date. It can store up to 72 hours of audio before it automatically begins purging the earliest entries. Igniter. This device produces a small flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Omnitool. This multipurpose gadget contains a plethora of useful tools: small knives of various sizes, a small hammer, screwdrivers, a file, a bottle opener, a small saw, a wrench, a can opener, a wire-cutter, and a small set of pliers. Quadcorder. This handheld scanning device has four prominent sensors (each looking like a small radar dish) on its operating end. When directed at an object within 5 feet as an action, the device measures and displays many of that object's intrinsic properties, including its temperature, density, boiling point, freezing point, conductivity, and viscosity. Roach. Ocoulori Radavitis is an insectlike creature that is consumed to improve the results of a void jump. See the Ships chapter for more details. Sling. A sling is a strap which attaches to a two\u0002handed ranged weapon (usually a blaster) and is worn on the body, usually over a shoulder, to make the weapon's weight easier to bear. When you drop a weapon attached to a sling you are wearing, it falls to your side and continues to hang within reach. Tactical Vest. This light vest is covered in pouches, straps, and holsters. The vest can carry a two-handed melee weapon on its back and a dagger or an antimatter dagger on its front. It has two holsters and one sling can attach to it. The tactical vest can be worn atop armor. Vent Tape. This durable adhesive tape is useful for any application that involves sticking two things together. While more creative minds might use large quantities of vent tape for other uses, most people use it for quick repairs and to affix flashlights to blasters in a pinch. A single roll of vent tape contains 60 feet of 2-inch wide tape. Wristwatch. A simple device with a simple purpose, this watch reports the time in a way that is consistent with all major galactic factions.</p><h1>Tools</h1><p>A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. In many science fiction settings, tools such as cartographer’s tools and weaver’s tools are rendered almost entirely obsolete by high-tech alternatives.

A circuitry kit contains a soldering iron, spare wire, and dozens of spare arcane components, such as abjurators, illusiometers, evocation shifters, and conjuration processors—everything necessary to rewire a piece of magical technology. Proficiency with this kit allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any checks you make to build, modify, and repair handheld gadgets, such as blasters, which contain an arcane battery. Mechanist's Tools. This kit contains a wide variety of tools used for metalworking and robotics, including a compact saw-grinder-mill tool, a welding torch and mask, an auto-hammer, and a lathe. It also includes enough scrap metal to begin and end most inexpensive projects. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to build, repair, and modify constructs and complex machines. Ship Maintenance Tools. These tools are essential for keeping starships spaceworthy and repairing them after combat. Each component in this extensive set of tools is intricate and extremely specialized, and can be used to fix virtually every part of a ship, from disabled systems, to external hull damage, to problems in the Dark Matter engine itself. Proficiency with this kit helps you repair ships more quickly and easily, adding your proficiency bonus to checks you make to repair your ship.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Services","type":"text","_id":"nKxY8iM8ygDYwY3Q","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>On your adventures, you can pay nonplayer characters to assist you or act on your behalf in a variety of circumstances.

A vect can install construct grafts without assistance, unless the graft is installed into the Head or Arm slots.</p><p>Vect require no recovery time and suffer no penalties after adding a construct graft.</p><p><em><strong>Body Slots.</strong></em> Each graft takes up one of the following slots: Arms, External, Head, Internal, or Legs. You can't have more than one graft in the same body slot. For instance, if you already have an arm graft, you must remove it before you can attach a different arm graft.</p><p><em><strong>Cost.</strong></em> The cost of obtaining and installing construct grafts are shown on the Graft Cost table below. Most of these can be acquired at far cheaper rates, if one is willing to track down a disreputable establishment specializing in dealing grafts and accept the risks inherent to an unsanitary operation.</p><h1>Grafts</h1><table><thead><tr><td><em><strong>Graft</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Cost</strong></em></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adamantine Plating</td><td>2,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Arcane Synapses</td><td>325 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Arm Blade</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Arm Cannon</td><td>450 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Battlefist 200</td><td>gp</td></tr><tr><td>Concentration Module</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Embedded Phaser</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Embedded Translator</td><td>500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Final Word</td><td>50,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Finger Picks</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Heart of Steel</td><td>2,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy Legs</td><td>800 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Impulse Unit</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Infrasight Eyes</td><td>450 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Logic Unit</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Mithral Plating</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Overdrive Module</td><td>750 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Replacement</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Shield Module</td><td>550 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Spiked Plating</td><td>750 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Tesla Module</td><td>350 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Thermoregulator</td><td>500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Traction Spikes</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Wings</td><td>5,500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The following construct grafts are listed alphabetically.</p><h3>Adamantine Plating</h3><p><strong>Slot:</strong> External</p><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Vect race</p><p>Your Armor Class equals 17 and any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. You can't wear conventional armor while you have this graft installed. You can only install this graft if you are proficient with heavy armor.</p><h3>Arcane Synapses</h3><p><strong>Slot:</strong> Head</p><p>You have stolen a bit of arcane potential by inserting some additional arcane nerves into your brain. You learn one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your casting ability for this cantrip.</p><h3>Arm Blade</h3><p><strong>Slot:</strong> Arms</p><p>Whenever you would normally be able to draw a weapon, you can collapse your mechanical hand into your forearm with a flick of the wrist, extending a wide shortsword in its place. You can revert it to its normal form whenever you could normally stow a weapon. While this weapon is installed, you are proficient with it and can't be disarmed of it. You can't hold or otherwise manipulate a weapon, shield, or other object with an arm that is transformed. Arm Cannon Slot: Arms One of your arms is replaced wholesale with a powerful blaster cannon. This arm cannon lacks any hand or manipulator, so you can't use that arm to hold or manipulate objects while the arm cannon is installed. Only one of your arms can be an arm cannon. An arm cannon is a blaster that deals 2d8 radiant damage on a hit and has the Blaster (range 30/120) property. You are proficient with it and can't be disarmed of it. Concentration Module Slot: Internal Prerequisite: Spellcasting feature Your body houses a mechanical mind, secondary to your true mind, to assist in arcane focus. Whenever you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of your Constitution modifier, to the roll. Embedded Battlefist Slot: Arms You replace one of your hands (your choice) with an imposing, articulated gauntlet, a battlefist. While this weapon is installed, you are proficient with it and can't be disarmed of it. Additionally, it has the Light property. Embedded Phaser Slot: Arms One of your hands is mechanical and can transform into a phaser. You can transform your hand into a phaser any time you would normally be able to draw a weapon, and can revert it to its normal form when you could normally stow a weapon. You are proficient with this weapon and can't be disarmed of it. You can't hold or otherwise manipulate a weapon, shield, or other object with an arm that is transformed. Embedded Translator Slot: Head</p><p>You have a universal translator magic item installed within your skull and can use the effects of it at will. Final Word Slot: Internal Deep within your body, you have installed a devastating arcane warhead, whose trigger is linked to your life. When you die, this bomb detonates, destroying your body completely; as a result, you can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. Each creature within 180 feet must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures within 60 feet that have Evasion or a similar feature can’t avoid this damage. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d4 mega (1d4 × 100) force damage, of half as much on a successful save. Finger Picks Slot: Arms Your mechanical hand has retractable thieves’ tools built directly into the fingers. You are always considered to have these thieves’ tools on your person and can conceal them perfectly. If you are proficient with thieves’ tools, you can add a +2 bonus to ability checks you make using them. Heart of Steel Slot: Internal You have replaced your heart with the core from a construct. As a result, you can ignore the effects of 1 level of exhaustion, and you only need to rest for 4 hours to gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Because vect already have construct cores, they can’t install this graft. Heavy Legs Slot: Legs A mechanical exoskeleton, rooted in your legs, helps carry your weight. Your lifting and carrying capacity doubles. Impulse Unit Slot: Legs You have installed thrusters into your legs and back. On your turn, you can use 10 feet of your movement to leap 10 feet vertically. In zero-gravity environments, this allows you to move 20 feet in any direction on your turn. Infrasight Eyes Slot: Head You have replaced your eyes with sensors that can see in the dark. You gain darkvision, the ability to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Logic Unit Slot: Head Having augmented your brain with an algorithmic processing unit, you have advantage on Intelligence checks to perform mathematical operations and solve logical dilemmas. Mithral Plating Slot: External Prerequisite: Vect race Your Armor Class equals 14 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you have resistance to lightning damage. You can only install this graft if you are proficient with light armor. Overdrive Module Slot: Internal You have installed an internal generator, which can accelerate your metabolism for a short while. You can use your bonus action to fire up your Overdrive Module. For up to the next minute, whenever you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, rolling a 19 counts as rolling a 20. This effect ends early if you roll a 1. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again. Replacement Slot: Any One or more of your organs or limbs has been interchanged with an efficient mechanical version. A replacement can effectively solve any amputation or organ failure, but they can't return to life someone that has died; such work is solely the domain of necromancy. Replacement limbs can look like the original limb, or can appear metallic or otherwise mechanical. A replacement organ or limb takes up one body slot relevant to it; for example, a robotic hand takes the Arms slot and a replacement kidney takes up the Internal slot. Shield Module Slot: External</p><p>By activating this mechanical plate installed near your spine, you can cast the spell mage armor as a bonus action targeting yourself, without using a spell slot. Once you do so, you can’t cast the spell again using this graft until you finish a long rest. Spiked Plating Slot: External Your Armor Class equals 14 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum +2). Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 piercing damage and, whenever you begin your turn grappling another creature, that creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. You can only install this graft if you are proficient with medium armor. Tesla Module Slot: Internal This device, installed in your chest, electrically polarizes your skin and discharges a shock of electricity to attackers. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 lightning damage to each creature within 5 feet of you. Thermoregulator Slot: Internal This component protects your body from extremely hot or cold conditions, allowing you to endure the Extreme Temperatures (see Appendix E) of space and other harsh environments without taking damage. Traction Spikes Slot: Legs Retractable spikes in your legs and feet allow you to climb more quickly. Climbing no longer halves your speed and you have advantage on saving throws against being moved against your will or knocked prone. Wings Slot: External Folded into your back and resembling a hump when not in use, these silver, clockwork wings allow you to soar. You can deploy or retract these wings as a bonus action. While deployed, they grant you a flying speed equal to your base movement speed. You can fly with these wings for a total of 10 minutes, after which, you must finish a short or long rest before using them again. Additionally, as a reaction while falling, you can deploy your wings to glide gently to the ground. You can do so even if you have no time remaining to use your wings.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"Magic Items","type":"text","_id":"7WU5RJK9jSsPM5Fd","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Magic Items</h1><p>Starships, blasters, construct cores, and jetpacks are all fueled by magic, which is harnessed through technology, resulting in the hybrid of magical tech that is prevalent throughout the ‘verse. At its most sophisticated, these devices straddle the line between machine and magic item, even as the latter becomes rarer and the former becomes exponentially more abundant.</p><p>This section contains many magic items, ranging from the extremely rare, like the incredibly powerful doom gauntlet, to the increasingly commonplace, such as drone controllers. Items which are of Common and Uncommon rarities can typically be bought and sold in well-stocked marketplaces.</p><p>All the items presented in this section are considered magical technology for the purposes of spells and magical effects that influence such technology.</p><h3>Ankh of Ra</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This golden holy symbol, blessed by the Sun Above, shields you from death. When you drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage while you are attuned to the ankh, you instead regain 4d10 hit points. The ankh then loses its luster and becomes nonmagical.</p><h3>Arcane Terminal</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>Arcane terminals are essential units of computing in the 'verse. Most information, from public databanks to private financial records, are stored on such terminals. These terminals weigh 800 pounds and come equipped with a keyboard, monitor, and antenna.</p><p>A terminal can store data, search its contents, and transfer data to other terminals. You can enter text into a terminal using the keyboard and search for data using queries of any length. A terminal can hold an arbitrarily large amount of text; the equivalent of hundreds of encyclopedias, but its storage of images and video is much more strictly limited. If you connect an arcane terminal by cable to another terminal, a ship's computer, or a datapad, you can transfer information between these devices.</p><p>With permission, it is possible to use one terminal to search the data of another. The most common use of this is to query the extensive amoeboid Compendium, which is located on a network of arcane terminals spread across dozens of maws, accessible from any given maw.</p><p>You can also use a terminal to compute mathematical problems, process data sets, and perform simulations using extensive amount of recorded data.</p><p>The arcane terminal's antenna enables datapads within 1 mile of it to communicate with short messages.</p><p><em>Arcane terminals</em> are also generally locked with a password associated with each user. Only someone with the password can access the terminal (barring unauthorized access, which can be accomplished with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Data) check to hack the terminal).</p><h3>Arcane Warhead</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p><p>This 4,000-pound bomb is capable of cataclysmic destruction. You can arm the warhead over the course of a minute if you know the warhead's command code and have a specially-made key attuned to it. Once the warhead is armed, you can set its method of detonation: Timed or Impact. If you choose a timed detonation, you enter a delay time of 1 minute, 10 minutes, or 1 hour, after which the warhead detonates. If you choose impact, the bomb lays dormant until it takes 1 mega hit point of damage, which might happen if it falls a suitable distance.</p><p>When the arcane warhead detonates, each creature and object within a 10-mile radius takes 10d10 + 200 mega radiant damage. Each creature within a 100-mile radius must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 10d10 + 50 radiant damage, or half as much on a successful save. This damage bypasses resistance and immunity to damage, and can't be avoided by Evasion or similar features. A creature that takes damage from this warhead becomes poisoned for 24 hours. The epicenter of the blast becomes a permanent 5d10 + 5 feet wide Dead Magic Zone. Attractor Mine Wondrous item, uncommon As an action, you can prime this small metallic disk and throw it to a space within 40 feet. Upon landing, the disk crackles with electricity and draws objects within a 5-foot cube toward it. If a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't move or take reactions until the start of its next turn. After 1 minute, the mine burns out and becomes nonmagical. BEG-3000 Weapon (singularity emitter), legendary An experimental singularity emitter of unrivaled power, the BEG is perhaps several iterations away from being completely stable. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend a charge to fire an unstable singularity from this weapon. When you do so, roll a d20. On a roll of 5 lower, the weapon expends all of its remaining charges, instead of only one. The singularity travels up to 60 feet to a point you can see within range, then explodes. Each creature within a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 10d10 force damage, or half as much on a successful save. After this, the weapon overheats and can't spend another charge or attack until the end of your next turn. Cryogenic Pod Wondrous item, very rare This capsule, large enough to fit one Medium-size creature, can provide air and heat for its occupant indefinitely. When a creature inside the pod activates it as an action, the pod cryogenically freezes them over the course of a minute, petrifying them as well as the rest of the pod's contents. The pod then locks. Petrified creatures don't age. Another creature can use their action to un\u0002petrify the creature, which unfreezes over the course of a minute. The pod then unlocks.</p><h3>Death Ray</h3><p><em>Weapon (repeater), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The weapon also has 2 charges, and regains 1d2 expended charges daily at dawn. While attuned to it, you can spend one charge to cast the spell disintegrate (DC 16) at a target you can see within range.</p><p>Deconstructive Nanobots</p><p>Wondrous item, rare</p><p>This capsule, which looks identical to that which contains reconstructive nanobots, contains a swarm of extremely dangerous nanobots, designed to reduce complex objects to their basic materials. You can use your action to open the canister and administer it, or throw it up to 15 feet (treating the canister as an improvised weapon). If the nanobots hit a creature, that creature takes an irreducible 1d4 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns for the next minute. If the nanobots hit an object, that object takes an irreducible 1d10 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns for the next minute. At the end of this duration, the nanobots deactivate. Dome Projector Wondrous item, uncommon Throwing this egg-shaped device at the ground as an action activates it, creating a dome of force as if you had cast the spell geodesic shield. The projector burns out and becomes nonmagical after 10 minutes as the dome of force collapses. Doom Gauntlet Weapon (repulsor gauntlet), legendary (requires attunement) You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The gauntlet contains a single charge. When you hit a target with an attack made with this weapon, you can expend this charge to deal an additional 1d4 mega (1d4 × 100) force damage. Once this charge is expended, roll a d4. On a roll of 1, the weapon collapses into dust. On any other roll, the weapon takes 3d6 days to regain its charge. Double Laser Blade Weapon (laser sword), rare The long hilt of this laser sword projects a second blade from its far end. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. Instead of having the Versatile property, this weapon has the Two-Handed property. Additionally, when you use the Attack action with this weapon, you can make a second attack using it as a bonus action.</p><p>Drive Disk Wondrous item, rare By grasping the two handles on this foot-wide disk, you can cast the spell Telaros's speedcycle. The disk becomes the steering wheel of the speedcycle, which materializes beneath you. Once Telaros's speedcycle is cast from the disk, it can't be used again until the following dawn. Drone Controller Wondrous item, common (requires attunement) This set of controls, either installed in a glove, integrated onto a datapad, or linked into a visor, allows you to control a drone. Each controller is linked to a single drone, either a defense drone, a medical drone, or a recon drone (see Monsters chapter for statistics). You can be attuned to up to three drone controllers at one time, as long as each controller is linked to a different type of drone. While attuned to the controller, you can use your bonus action to command the drone to use its reaction to move to a location within 60 feet of you and use an action it is capable of. Unless commanded, drones do not act. You can also use your action to see and hear through its sensor array until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefit of the drone’s special senses, but becoming blind and deaf with regard to your own senses during that time. Encyclopedia Multiplanaria Wondrous item, legendary This datapad is enchanted to hold an incredible wealth of information. However, the data is not indexed, so the datapad only provides data that it believes will be useful at any given moment. The datapad has 3 charges, and regains all charges daily at dawn. You can use your action to access the datapad when you make an Intelligence check to gain a +20 bonus to the roll. Energy Shield Bracer Armor (shield), common (requires attunement) This metal bracer has a sophisticated energy projector on its back. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause a shield composed of shimmering, translucent energy to appear on your wrist. While in this form, it functions like a normal shield, except you can't drop it or be disarmed of it. The shield lasts until you use a bonus action to collapse it again. Enigma Ring Wondrous item, common This ring, which has two rows of letters and numbers running around its circumference, can be used to encrypt or decrypt messages using complicated cyphers. When you speak a command word to the ring, the letters and numbers reorganize into a configuration unique to that command word. Messages can only be decrypted if encrypted using the same command word. Etheradio Wondrous item, very rare An essential tool for galactic communication, an etheradio transmits and receives its messages though the Ethereal Plane. This device stands over 6-feet tall (with an antenna that extends its length by an additional 3 feet) and weighs over 1,000 pounds. A single operator can man the device, sending audio messages to other etheradios on the same plane of existence, or listening to messages sent to it. By broadcasting on an emergency channel, an etheradio can send a message to all other etheradios on the same plane of existence, but it can only send such a message once per day. No matter the distance to the receiver, messages tend to take 10 minutes to propagate. An etheradio only works if it is calibrated according to its location in the universe. Calibrating this device takes an hour, and it must be recalibrated if it is ever moved more than 100 miles. Calibration takes into account regular cosmic motion, such as a planet's orbit.</p><h3>Gamestation-7331</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, common</em></p><p>This special version of datapad is scaled down and packed with dozens of digital amusements and diversions that test your reflexes and puzzle-solving skills. If you spend a short rest playing on this gamestation, you gain a +1 bonus to the next attack roll you make until you take a short or long rest.</p><p>Golem Skin Armor (light), very rare (requires attunement) This lightly armored suit is traced in intricate, glowing arcane circuitry, and has a series of attachment points and nodes covering its surface. You can install construct grafts into this suit, which has four body slots: Arms, External, Head, and Legs. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC, and you gain the benefits of any construct grafts installed in the suit, though you lose the benefits of any grafts you have attached to your own body (except those in the Internal slot). Additionally, this suit comes with an arm blade graft attached to its Arms slot. Grasshopper Weapon (phaser), rare On a hit, this magic weapon deals an additional 2d10 radiant damage and the target is pushed 10 feet away from you. The weapon then overheats. An overheated weapon can't be used to make an attack again until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Gravity Nullifier Wondrous item, uncommon As an action, this fist-sized metal device can be attached to an object weighing less than 2,000 pounds, nullifying the object’s mass temporarily, as if it were targeted by the levitate spell. This effect can be activated and deactivated as an action by pressing a button on the side of the device. If the gravity nullifier is removed from the object, it permanently ceases to function. Hivemaster Pistol Weapon (swarm pistol), rare You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Once per turn, when you fire this swarm pistol automatically, you can choose to fire 6 times with disadvantage instead of twice. The pistol then deals 1d4 radiant damage, instead of 2d4, on a hit. Holo-Companion Wondrous item, uncommon When the button set into the top of this small, faceted orb is pressed, holo-emitters generate a translucent humanoid figure, which the orb floats inside. This figure functions identically to the spell unseen servant, though it is visible (with an appearance determined by the crafter). The holo-companion remains active indefinitely, answering to the orders of whomever activated the sphere, until the companion takes damage or the activator speaks a command word to deactivate it. Hoverboard Wondrous item, rare This 3-foot long metal board produces a low hum and curiously hovers above any surface. You can mount or dismount this board as a bonus action. While mounted, you ignore nonmagical difficult terrain and can move above the surface of liquids without sinking. Additionally, if you move at least 15 feet in a line downhill on your turn, your speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn. The board can't scale any angle greater than 45 degrees, unless it is moving in a zero-gravity environment. In zero gravity, the board moves across any surface as if it were downhill. Lastly, you can use a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, instead of a Charisma (Performance) check, to perform tricks on the board. Hullcutter Weapon (plasma cutter or thermal lance), rare When this weapon hits a ship or a creature of mega size, it deals 1 mega hit point of damage.</p><p>Hyper-Krash Potion, rare This legendary can of Krash-branded energy drink was discontinued decades ago for being too extreme (as well as for hazardous side effects stemming from its magical additives). After you drink this potion, a jittery feeling rushes to your extremities. On your following turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Additionally, you have advantage on all attack rolls and ability checks on that turn. Once that turn is over, you feel more exhausted than you did before and can't gain the benefits of this potion for 24 hours. Jetpack Wondrous item, uncommon This device is a miniature version of the impulse engines used in starships, which has been fitted with straps and a small handheld controller. While wearing it on your back, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can fly with a jetpack for a total of 1 minute each day, after which it can’t be used until it recharges at dawn. Motion Tracker Wondrous item, rare This device is a small metal tablet with an illuminated screen on one side of it. While holding it, you can use it to determine the location of any creatures or objects within 60 feet of you that have moved during the last round, even if they are invisible or otherwise hidden from view. A creature can avoid detection by the motion tracker by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check at the beginning of its turn. If the creature moves within the motion tracker’s range, it must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check for every 5 feet it moves to avoid detection. Personal Shield Emitter Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) This small, jeweled amulet resembles a tiny shield. While wearing it, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you can use a reaction when you are hit by an attack to momentarily overcharge the shield, granting you a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, until the start of your next turn. After being used in this way, the shield emitter must recharge for 24 hours before it can be overcharged again. Potion of Quantum Effect Potion, rare When you drink this potion, your body falls out of phase with reality and gains bizarre quantum properties for one hour. During this time, you gain a flying speed of 5 feet and you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Additionally, you can use your bonus action to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied location you can see. This potion contains a small animal (usually an insect) suspended in the liquid in a quantum state of life and death, which is broken when the bottle is opened.</p><h3>Potion of Solar Radiance</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“Can you absolutely, positively assure me that this potion isn't irradiated?</p><p>— Barrakus Rifgan, bartender, before drinking a potion of solar radiance</p></blockquote></div><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, your body sheds bright white light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet for the next hour. The light is sunlight. Until this duration ends, you can use a bonus action on your turn to deal 1d8 radiant damage to each creature within the bright light. Its liquid is an opaque silver and glows brightly when shaken.</p><h3>Rebounding Blade</h3><p><em>Weapon (laser sword), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the Thrown (range 40/120) property and, immediately after any thrown attack, the weapon flies back to your hand. Additionally, you can use your action to throw the sword in a whirling arc before it returns to your hand. When you do so, you can make two attacks against different targets within 40 feet, making a separate attack roll for each target. Reconstructive Nanobots Wondrous item, rare This capsule, indistinguishable from a capsule of deconstructive nanobots, contains a swarm of short-lived nanobots that will set about repairing anything once released. You can use your action to open the canister and administer it, or throw it up to 15 feet (treating the canister as an improvised weapon). If the nanobots hit a creature, that creature regains 1d4 hit points at the beginning of each of its turns for the next minute. At the end of this duration, the nanobots deactivate.</p><p>Reflex Holster Wondrous item, common This holster can be adapted to hold any blaster at your hip, thigh, shoulder, or back. A blaster holstered in this way can be drawn at a moment's notice, even outside of your turn, without using a reaction. When you draw a weapon from this holster, it doesn't count against the number of objects you can interact with on your turn. Relay Station Wondrous item, uncommon This device extends the range of nearby signals. Comm sets within 100 miles of this device can communicate with each other and with communication systems within that range. Multiple relay stations can be placed to extend this signal further, as long as each station is within range of each other. Remote Piloting Apparatus Wondrous item, rare This interconnected array of devices can be installed in a fighter-sized ship with 1 hour of work and a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. Once the apparatus is installed, the fighter can be deployed and piloted remotely from a controller unit included with the apparatus, which relays visual and sensor information from the fighter. A character can enter the Dogfighter ship role by using his controller unit. If the fighter strays more than 10 miles from the controller, it loses connection and falls dormant until the controller unit is within signal range. Ring of Paradoxes Ring, legendary While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the spell paradox from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge. Ring of Spacewalking Ring, uncommon (requires attunement) While attuned to this ring, you can breathe normally and survive underwater or in the vacuum of space without ill effect. While in a zero-gravity environment, you can fly with a speed of 15 feet. Shoulder Cannon Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) This cannon has 4 charges, and it regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. The cannon apparatus is worn on the back and produces a shoulder-mounted blaster above your left shoulder when activated. While attuned to the cannon, you use an action and expend one of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 120 feet. The cannon has a +7 attack bonus and can see invisible creatures. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. If you begin your turn incapacitated or unconscious, the cannon will automatically attack the nearest hostile creature it can see within its range without requiring an action. Skeleton Keycard Wondrous item, legendary This black keycard, emblazoned with a white skull, is imbued with magic that can unlock any door. As an action, you can use this keycard on any door which could be hacked, such as those on a ship, even if such a door doesn't have a keycard reader. The door becomes unlocked, as if targeted by the knock spell, and opens. Sorting Beast Wondrous item, rare The sorting beast is a six-legged construct with eyes, legs, and antennae at both ends and an array of measuring devices near its center. It can manipulate and hold objects up to 30 pounds in weight. When activated as an action, the sorting beast sets about collecting and sorting all loose valuable items within 100 feet. It sorts all gold pieces, silver pieces, and copper pieces into neat stacks of 10. For material goods, such as precious stones, the sorting beast can appraise value by weight and quality, before sorting the goods appropriately and printing the result on a fine paper strip. The sorting beast continues sorting until finished or deactivated as an action. Additionally, the sorting beast can cast the spell identify, without using material components, on one object you designate each day. Spider Pod Wondrous item, common When you throw this oblong metal container as an action, it unfolds into a mechanical spider (see Monsters chapter for statistics). Your spider acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. If the spider drops to 0 hit points, it can't be repaired. Furthermore, the spider can't collapse back down into its pod. You can only have 3 mechanical spiders under your control at any time. Tachyon Missile Weapon (special), uncommon This shoulder-mounted cannon fires a heat-seeking rocket designed to penetrate a ship's hull. This martial weapon has the Blaster (range 2,000/6,000), Heavy, and Two\u0002Handed properties. Before firing this weapon, you must first use your action to lock on to a ship or mega creature you can see within range. You remain locked on to that target as long as it remains within range and doesn't take Evasive Maneuvers. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 mega necrotic damage. Taser Net Weapon (net), rare This net of woven cables is fixed with dozens of crackling electrodes. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with this net, it takes 1d8 lightning damage. Additionally, while its target is restrained, it takes an additional 1d8 lightning damage at the beginning of each of its turns and it can't take reactions. Because this net is a magic item, slashing it doesn't destroy it or free a creature restrained by it. Terraforming Engine Wondrous item, legendary This extraordinary machine, standing 40 feet tall and weighing tens of thousands of pounds, can breathe life into entire worlds. The engine, set on treads with great smokestacks rising from its chassis, transmutes minerals and balances the atmosphere to support life. The engine can be activated or deactivated with 1 minute of work. If set down on a Tier 4 or higher planet, activated, and allowed to process the planet's water, atmosphere, and soil for a year, the engine lowers the planet's Tier by 1. The engine has no effect on a Tier 1 or Tier X world, and two terraforming engines can't lower a planet's Tier by more than 1 (though multiple engines might provide an attractive redundancy, should one fail). If the engine is deactivated or removed from the planet, the planet degrades to its original condition over the course of 7 days.</p><h3>Thaumatonic Rifle, +1, +2, or +3</h3><p><em>Blaster (standard carbine), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3) (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em></p><p>This magical standard carbine gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls as determined by its rarity. Additionally, it functions as a spell focus. When you cast a spell while holding the rifle, you can add its magical bonus to the spell’s attack roll and saving throw DC. Thunder Rifle Weapon (concussion rifle), rare You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a target with an attack made with this weapon, any creature within a 5-foot radius centered on the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage as the target and be pushed up to 5 feet away from it. Objects of Small size and smaller within this radius that aren't being worn or carried also take this damage and are pushed. Titan Frame Armor (heavy), legendary (requires attunement) This Large frame, which weighs in excess of 4,000 pounds, seems less like a suit of armor and more like a mechanized, bipedal vehicle. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits: • You gain a +2 bonus to AC. • Your Strength score becomes 23, if it were lower. • You are considered a Large creature, if you were smaller. • Your base walking speed increases to 30 feet, if it were lower. • The armor counts as a life suit. You can don and doff the armor as an action by traveling through a series of hatches on the front of the suit.</p><p>Transmat Deck Wondrous item, uncommon The transmat deck is a handheld device with a large, flat screen that is connected to an extradimensional space. As an action, you can touch an object that isn't being worn or carried to the deck, teleporting it to the extradimensional space. The object must be less than 4 feet across in every dimension and weigh less than 150 pounds. The transmat deck can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. Its inventory can be viewed on its screen. As an action while holding the deck, you can select any item stored in the space and teleport it to your hands or an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. A deck is also generally locked with a password associated with its owner. Only someone with the password can store or retrieve items from the space (barring unauthorized access, which can be accomplished with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Data) check to hack the device). If the transmat deck is destroyed, its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. Placing the deck in an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding or similar item (or storing such an item in the transmat deck) instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened. Universal Translator Wondrous item, rare This handheld device, a necessity for distant voyages, translates any spoken language. While you hold it, you can understand any spoken language you hear. Moreover, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear you can understand what you say. Vari-Blaster Blaster (any), rare This magical blaster has a revolving set of five power cells. As an action or bonus action on your turn, you can change the blaster’s damage type to cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or radiant damage. Additionally, this blaster deals a bonus 1d6 damage on a hit. Void Beacon Wondrous item, uncommon This device transmits an ultra-high frequency signal through the Void. As such, this beacon can be detected tens of thousands of light years away on most communication systems. However, its signal is so compressed that only 16 characters of information can be encoded in its transmission (spaces count as characters). Once activated, the beacon transmits its repeated message for 7 days and then burns out permanently. Its message can manually be changed as an action. Weapon Wheel Wondrous item, uncommon This device, a bracer with an affixed rotary dial and several buttons lining its circumference, is connected to nine small extradimensional spaces. While wearing this bracer, you can use an action to deposit any weapon or object you are holding that weighs no more than 100 pounds and which can fit into a 10-foot cube into one of the extradimensional spaces, linking that item to the wheel. The wheel can be linked to up to 9 items at a time, one in each extradimensional space. You can use an action to unlink an item from the wheel. Once on each of your turns, as an object interaction when you take an action, you can cause one of the wheel's linked items to appear in your open hands. Doing so also causing any other items linked to the wheel to return their extradimensional spaces. W-REC Weapon (REC gun), rare You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which is fitted with dozens of absurd and unnecessary modifications. When you attack with this weapon automatically, you can make up to six attacks with it, but each attack made after the second rolls a cumulative additional d20 and takes the lowest result. For example, the weapon fires twice with disadvantage, makes a third attack by rolling three d20s and taking the lowest, makes a fourth attack by rolling four d20s and taking the lowest, and so on. Zipgun Weapon (special), uncommon This one-handed blaster is designed to be fired only once, but at far above nominal power. You can only fire it by first charging it as an action on your turn, during which time it makes a quiet zipping sound. On your next turn, you can use your action to make an attack with the blaster. If you don't make an attack with the blaster when it is charged, it harmlessly discharges and overheats. An attack with the blaster creates a blast 100-foot long by 5-foot wide line in a direction that you choose. Each creature in the line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the blaster is fired, it smolders and becomes nonmagical.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Artifacts","type":"text","_id":"VBJTfM5fhHJ1zhu3","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Campaign-shaking magic items, artifacts are utterly unique, singularly powerful objects. Whereas a normal magic item might be transformative to a character or a kingdom, artifacts are woven into the universe itself. Uncovering or vying to control an artifact can form the basis for entire campaigns, prompting the ascension of new villains and staunch allies around the characters. Some artifacts are merely objects of ruinous power, imbued with arcana from the very conception of the universe, when magic was still lithe and youthful. Others are stained with divine magic or are intertwined with the fabric of the multiverse. In most cases, however, an artifact's power is simply too great for mortal hands. Even if its might were placed in the right hands, the eventuality of sinister forces gaining control over it would spell inevitable doom. Adventurers, therefore, often make it their mission to destroy artifacts they encounter, a task which normally entails a great quest of its very own, for artifacts can't be sundered easily. No artifact should be placed in a campaign lightly. These items are as much plot devices as they are treasure; they appear when the GM desires and leave when the story demands it. For better or for worse, stories featuring artifacts will gravitate around the items' incredible power, so they should be used carefully, conservatively, and deliberately. This chapter contains three artifacts, all of which are key to Dark Matter and its universe: the Blaster Prototype, which is both a sentient item and an artifact, a link to the very core of the advanced technologies of the 'verse, the Gamma Pendant, an artifact which proves that hardlight magic was once mastered by an ancient and benevolent force, and Un's Codex, a gateway to the universe tied to Old Un himself. Blaster Prototype Weapon (repeater), artifact (requires attunement) Every blaster in the 'verse, from pocket-sized phasers to ship-mounted pulse cannons, operate on the same basic principle: focusing the energy from an arcane battery through an aperture to create an intense burst of radiation. However, the progenitor of these designs, an artifact of immense power, predates the invention of arcane batteries, and instead utilized a more potent power source: a mortal soul.</p><p>The <em>Blaster Prototype</em> was the magnum opus of legendary dwarven inventor Metzer Glimwrought. In his life, Glimwrought contributed to nearly every area of science, mathematics, and arcana, proving unsolved arcane conjectures, proposing new physical theories, and furnishing new designs for construct servants (which laid the groundwork for the invention of the vect). His final work, the Blaster Prototype, is simultaneously considered to be his greatest and most costly. In the last weeks of the Prototype's construction, Metzer had consolidated its major components, including his new focus aperture and chassis, but lacked the critical power source for the device. His notes indicate that he might have planned to ensnare numerous elemental spirits, undead specters, or even demons into a void crystal capacitor, but his actual plan was never implemented. Before the device's completion, Metzer's daughter, Vantha Glimwrought, suddenly took ill. Metzer traveled from temple to temple, but it seemed no cleric could heal her. Unabated, the unnamed disease ravaged the young woman, and she soon laid upon her death bed. With no other options, Metzer resigned from the Jormund University of Magic and Science and turned to necromancy. Metzer drew his daughter's soul into the Prototype, using a ritual similar to that which binds a lich's phylactery. As a result, Vantha was spared death indefinitely, for her soul resided within the Prototype. Magic Weapon. The Blaster Prototype is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. Random Properties. The blaster has the following randomly determined properties: • 2 minor beneficial properties • 1 major beneficial property Blaster Configuration. The blaster can be configured in a number of different ways to change its mode of fire. You can use a bonus action to switch its configuration. Automatic. The blaster gains the Automatic property and its damage dice become 2d8. Lock-On. You can use your action to deal 2d6 radiant damage to a creature you can see within 30 feet without making an attack roll. Overheat. The blaster gains the Overheat property and deals twice as many damage dice (4d6) on a hit. Ricochet. Unless a target has total cover on all sides, the blaster ignores cover. Also, its damage dice become 2d8. Scatter. The blaster gains the Scatter (2d8) property. Additionally, you don't suffer disadvantage from attacking with the blaster while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature. Sniper. The blaster gains the Sighted property, its range doubles (becoming 120/480 feet), and its damage dice become 2d8.</p><p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>Blaster Prototype</em> is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p><p>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Dwarven. It can also speak with constructs and machines as if it shared a language with them, and can communicate over comm sets within 1 mile of it.</p><p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> Though the blaster itself is ageless, its personality belongs to a young woman, Vantha Glimwrought, and speaks in an upbeat, chipper tone. The Prototype urges its user to explore and travel to new places, to feed its voracious appetite for meeting new, interesting people; by contrast, it hates being holstered, hidden away, or left alone for too long. It would seem that even in life, Vantha was shut away, and built up an insatiable wanderlust as a result.</p><p>Vantha has complex feelings about her father. She didn't know him exceptionally well when she was alive, for Metzer spent most of his time working or teaching at the university. Without question, she's grateful to be alive, but feels like her present, captive circumstances are somehow an extension of her father's overbearing nature, even after death.</p><p>Vantha has extreme reservations about being used on humanoids and will never fire on an innocent person.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Blaster.</strong></em> The Blaster Prototype is protected by all manner of enchantments from one of history's most talented and ingenious arcanists, rendering it impervious to damage. However, if the blaster is connected to a sufficiently large power source, like a Class 7 or 8 Dark Matter engine at the moment of a void jump, the power surge would be enough to overload the blaster, destroying it.</p><h3>Gamma Pendant</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em></p><p>As far as arcane science is concerned, the discovery of hardlight is second only to the discovery of Dark Matter engines. While the use of pure magical force had been used for eons to create simple, intangible constructs, hardlight allowed mages of all stripes to create monuments of magical majesty, brilliant constructs of solid, crystalline light, and delicate, complex machines with but a thought. Modern hardlight magics were uncovered through experimentation and happenstance, like many technological advancements; however, it would seem this was not the first time they had been discovered, mastered, and harnessed, as evidenced by the Gamma Pendant. This pendant is a gleaming, mithral medallion, set with what appears to be a large emerald or some other green crystal. However, on closer inspection, the gem reveals itself to be a permanent hardlight construct of staggering complexity. Found near the very edge of the ‘verse, the pendant’s first owner (an elf whose name has been lost to time) discovered that the tiny object not only possessed immense magical power, but an intelligence as well. Shortly thereafter, a being known only as the Nomad began appearing across the galaxy. Though the Nomad’s description varied drastically, the creature always possessed glowing green eyes, a unique pendant adorning its chest, and an incredible, complex wealth of magic. In truth, the Nomad was none of these creatures; it was the pendant itself manifesting through its owners. More precisely, it is a being from a plane of existence far outside our own, whose power and consciousness somehow became entwined within the pendant’s intricate hardlight lattice. Magic Item. The Gamma Pendant is a hexagonal mithral pendant which attaches itself to the chest of the attuned user and always appears on the outermost layer of clothing or armor. Hardlight Constructs. You can use your action to create a melee weapon made of hardlight in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it and can use your spellcasting modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier on attack rolls made with it. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it deals force damage instead of its normal damage type. Flight. While attuned to the pendant, you have a flight speed equal to your movement speed. Additionally, you can breathe normally and survive underwater or in the vacuum of space without ill effect. Spells. The pendant has 50 charges. It regains 4d6 + 10 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the pendant regains 1d12 + 1 charges. While attuned to the pendant, you can expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: hardlight blaster (7th level, 10 charges), hardlight construction (7 charges), hardlight frame (7 charges), hardlight gauntlet (7th level, 10 charges), hardlight nails (3 charges), major image (5 charges), mega image (5 charges), orbital hardlight cannon (35 charges), shield (2 charges), spiritual weapon (4th level, 6 charges), telekinesis (7 charges), or wall of force (7 charges). You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the pendant without using any charges: detect magic, eldritch blast, hardlight needle, light, mage armor, or mage hand. Spell Absorption. While attuned to the pendant, you have advantage on saving throws you make against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you to cause the pendant to absorb the magic of the spell, canceling its effect. The pendant regains a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level, up to a maximum of 50 charges. Once you cancel and absorb a spell with the pendant, you can’t do so again until the next dawn. Sentience. The Gamma Pendant is a sentient lawful good wondrous item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand any language its bearer understands. Personality. Nomad is an extraplanar entity of formidable intellect and power, but lacks a corporeal form with which to influence and observe the world. Importantly, whatever dimension from which Nomad hails is completely foreign to our own; as such, Nomad has yet to learn many basic facts about our universe and its prominent lifeforms, though it has acquired a few insights in its time. For example, Nomad might know that living creatures can’t pass through solid material and that they generally die if exposed to the vacuum of space, but it might not yet understand that environments with extremely high gravity or lethal levels of radiation will have similar effects.</p><p>How Nomad became trapped in the pendant or who put it there is unknown, (Nomad either doesn’t know or isn’t willing to tell), but it doesn’t seem particularly bothered by its current situation. Nomad’s true motivations are grand and generally cryptic, pertaining to an unspoken, existential threat to the multiverse, including its home dimension. As such, it views most conflicts as petty squabbles in the scheme of things. Nomad is staunchly neutral on most matters. It generally scoffs at the perils faced by mortals and abhors the melodrama of adventure, though it will follow its bearer along in such quests as long as it is permitted time to conduct experiments with hardlight geometry in the interim. While it is certainly more than capable of taking over a given bearer, it is generally loath to do so, as the process imparts a general sense of mortality that Nomad finds distasteful. As such, it only ever actively possesses its bearer in the interest of self-preservation. Destroying the Pendant. The Gamma Pendant seems to be impervious to both damage and wear, both from magical and nonmagical sources. However, the lattice can be shattered by smashing it between two sufficiently large hardlight constructs: each would need to be roughly the size of a small planet to achieve the desired effect. Nomad also makes it known to the bearer that there is a much simpler way to destroy the pendant should they choose to do so: by allowing Nomad to possess them fully, obliterating their own soul in the process. The bearer in question must be both fully aware of the consequences and be completely willing to accept their fate.</p><h3>Un's Codex</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This 6-inch wide mechanical disc, consisting of innumerable layers of gears and technological ephemera, might seem innocuous at first. After all, it could easily be a spare component for any ship or magical device, albeit a strange one. But on further inspection, rotating one of its layers causes other layers to rotate, counter-rotate, or become locked. The disc itself is an intricate puzzle; solving it means to unlock the doors of the universe. The disc, called Un's Codex, may have a storied history, but much of it is lost to time. It is comprised of rare, exotic metals, of the very same type that can be found on maw stations and within the heart of the Sepulcher Star. Like all other antediluvian relics of such make, its creation is attributed to Old Un. After all, there are few others so venerable.</p><p>Finding solutions to the codex is challenging, but each solution creates a unique magical effect. A creature attuned to the Codex can spend 10 hours to uncover one of the Codex's solutions through experimentation, gaining the use of one of the Codex's traits of their choice (other than the Random Properties trait, which applies as soon as the creature attunes to the Codex). Random Properties. The codex has the following randomly determined properties:</p><ul><li><p>2 minor beneficial properties</p></li><li><p>1 major beneficial property</p></li><li><p>2 minor detrimental properties</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong></em> While attuned to the Codex, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p><p><em><strong>Slip Gate.</strong></em> The codex has 4 charges and regains 1 charge daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend one of its charges to open a 10-foot diameter portal between two precise points in the multiverse that you choose. These two locations can be anywhere in the 'verse, including on different planes of existence. These locations must be known to you, or you can specify a general location, such as a particular maw or the Elemental Plane of Fire. You can orient the portal in any direction that you choose.</p><p>The portal lasts for up to a minute, and you can dismiss it as an action. The portal has a front and a back in each location where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other location, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.</p><p>Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by the Codex from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.</p><p><em><strong>Extradimensional Lodge.</strong></em> You and up to 4 willing creatures within 30 feet that you choose are transported to a demiplane containing a rustic yet stately lodge. The lodge appears to be within a scenic, coniferous forest, but leaving the lodge teleports you back to the location from which you entered. The lodge has several floors and comfortable accommodations for dozens of individuals. It would seem that previous owners of the Codex have taken up residence here, for nonmagical weapons and equipment are stashed in a few of the rooms. Moreover, it seems that the lodge contains numerous hidden compartments and secret passages.</p><p>The lodge is attended by dozens of near-transparent servants, who obey all who enter. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus, the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the lodge but can't leave it.</p><p><em><strong>Blink Step.</strong></em> You can cast the spell misty step at will, without using a spell slot or spell components. When you cast this spell, you can choose to teleport to a space occupied by a creature. When you do so, that creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 force damage and moves to an adjacent space. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t move; you instead move to an adjacent space.</p><p><em><strong>Universal Function.</strong></em> You can use your action using the codex to overwrite some fundamental law of the universe in a 15-foot radius sphere around you. You can use this ability to increase or decrease gravity in the area, to change the boiling or melting point of a particular material within the area, to increase or decrease the flow of time in the area (as per the haste or slow spell), to make the region breathable (as per zone of atmosphere), or to change another fundamental law of your choice, at the GM’s discretion. If you attempt to change something that is too fundamental (such as attempting to reverse the flow of time in the area), the codex does nothing and your action is wasted. This change lasts for 1 minute or until you use this ability again.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Codex.</strong></em> Though the codex seems to be made of fragile components, its exotic composition makes it impervious to damage. The artifact can only be destroyed by Old Un itself, but casting it into the Sepulcher Star or any black hole will be sufficient to banish it for 1d100 years, after which time it will reappear somewhere in the 'verse.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":0,"name":"Firm Enemies","type":"text","_id":"f3aB9YSc21HnVp6O","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch05-equipment.webp\" /><blockquote><p>Alright you two, I’ll get the engine running. You ever flown one of these before?” “Don’t you worry, Rami, I know what I’m doing,” Nano assured her. “You’d better get on the pulse cannon, Mek. Never know what might be out there.”</p><p>The feathered monk obliged, lowering himself into a seat surrounded by shimmering scrying mirrors, with control yokes built into each arm. As he did so, the whole ship seemed to awaken with magical energy, Rami having found her way to the engine room.</p><p>“Fasten your seatbelts, everyone,” Nano announced, firing up the impulse thrusters, “we don’t exactly have clearance to take off, so this might be a little bumpy…”</p><p>And indeed it was, but once their Freelancer was clear of the station, they were away quickly, launching into a void jump moments after passing through the hangar doors. A blind jump, yes, but one Nano was familiar with. Besides, the Miaam-Osk Pathway had long been a favorite route for both smugglers and legitimate merchants, so even if the jump wasn’t entirely accurate, there would be enough beacons, signals and landmark planetoids to get back on track.</p><p>As the ship progressed through the void, Rami popped back to the bridge. “If them Firm boys are anywhere, they’ll be in the Whiteglass cluster at the far edge of the Miaam system. The asteroids there block all divination magic somehow. It’s a good place to hide…”</p><p>“…but it also means they won’t be able to see us coming.” Mekhet-Nu finished the thought. “Excellent. Let’s go steal us an arcane warhead.”</p><p>Sure enough, they touched down on one of the icy asteroids without any kind of interception. “Are you sure they’re here?” asked Mekhet-Nu, while he nonetheless readied his sunstaff in a battle stance.</p><p>“You saw the junk drifting around up there. Someone’s here, and if their lack of respect for interplanetary littering laws is anything to go by, I deduce they must be hardened criminals,” whispered Nano, expression unreadable.</p><p>“Did—did the vect just tell a joke?” Rami gawked.</p><p>Her bewilderment was interrupted by a flurry of blaster fire, which began to scythe through the party from an unseen pillbox, half buried in snow.</p><p>“Damn it!” Rami cursed, ducking and rolling to one side. Seeing Firm goons appearing out of their holes, she hurled a fireball, scorching the nearest group.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nano triggered a gadget, deploying a large hemisphere of force around the three of them. “Here, save your spells. I grabbed a carbine for you from the ship; it should be enough to hold them off while I get set up.”</p><p>“Set up?” Rami tried to ask, but another hail of fire came in, shattering the gadgeteer’s temporary dome. Hitting the deck, she used a cantrip to raise a low wall out of ice. “Blast it, Mek, get down!”</p><p>The avia-ra, several scorch marks already burned into his muscular chest, squawked as he fired his sunstaff into the attackers, but soon realized that Rami had a point. Against so many, defensive measures would be necessary.</p><p>The two of them exchanged shots with the smugglers, pinning some of them down, but doing little to reduce their numerical advantage. Before long, Firm gunmen were moving into flanking positions, and one of their leaders shouted: “I don’t know who you are, but anyone who thinks they can barge onto our asteroid and get away alive can’t be very smart! We’ll be taking that ship, too!”</p><p>Just then, Nano stopped working on a turret\u0002like device. “Don’t count your roaches before you’ve jumped, fleshbag!” The device then began to glow.</p><p>“Is that… should we…?” Rami stammered. “Yes, we should probably get out of the way. The targeting matrix in this is kind of… improvised.”</p><p>The three of them scrambled away, just in time to see Nano’s hastily-constructed turret let loose a beam of crackling energy, which then proceeded to sweep through the ranks of assailants, jerking up and down to eliminate targets both near and far.</p><p>When the screeching turret at last quieted, Nano was the first to speak. “Well, they aren’t storing the warhead on the surface at least. Thankfully for us. Come on, it must be somewhere inside.”</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Across the ‘verse, new advances are constantly pushing the pinnacle of technology. Fundamental limitations, like the speed of light and force of gravity, have long been broken by magic, but with the advent of magical technology, anyone can sidestep the bounds of physics. In most of the galaxy, space faring vessels are commonplace, blasters have replaced conventional firearms, and constructs, living and otherwise, have become a mundane sight.</p><p>Such high technology will be invaluable to adventurers and explorers, who risk their lives daily in the harsh expanse of space. This chapter details new options for magical technology, which ranges from essential gear to blasters and other weapons. The most advanced magical equipment is more potent and unique—essentially magic items in their own right. Additionally, this section contains a number of upgrade components, which can be installed directly into the bodies of vect or other creatures.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.x8rV3OrcnwdLB9bC"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bjgntohdazs"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668108264470,"modifiedTime":1668640014970,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"QFwxgxasmihesSQz"}

It was obvious, on closer inspection, that someone was trying just a bit too hard to evoke a certain ambiance here: the lights were magical after all, and Rami was sure the amoeboids that ran the station employed enough automatons to keep every square inch of it clean.</p><p>It wasn’t hard to find the door she was looking for, even with the poor light and lack of signage.

Rami pressed the big green button on the keypad, and the doors slid open.</p><p>Mekhet-Nu, first to see the other side, stepped forward as if in a trance. “Incredible,” he gasped after a few long moments. “this is a collection to rival a dragon’s hoard!”</p><p>“Not quite, I’m afraid,” came a voice from the back of the shop, “and besides, all that you see is for sale. I keep the real treasures elsewhere. Now, what can I do… oh. Now then, aren’t you two a strange pair. There must be quite a story here, do tell!”</p><p>“You must be Nano,” said Rami, refusing to be drawn. “Look, we just need a couple of gadgets that will help us—”</p><p>\"—break into somewhere and steal something? Yes, I know. It’s written all over your faces. Honestly, how do you organics ever manage to fool anyone?”</p><p>At this point, Mekhet-Nu stepped in. “Be that as it may, I see you have an impressive range of invisibility and nondetection devices here. We need the best ones you’ve got.”</p><p>“No, no, no.” The vect’s lively gesture was almost comical, given its expressionless, artificial face. “I know your type. All shadows and secrecy and buying things on credit that you don’t intend to pay off. If you want my help, you’ll at least have to tell me who you are and what you’re planning to steal.”</p><p>The two looked at each other. “Oh, have it your way. I’m Rami and this is Mek.“</p><p>“<em>Mekhet-Nu,</em>” he corrected.</p><p>“Mekhet-Nu the heretic nonbeliever. Yes. And we’re going to rob the Eternal Dragon, Garfreckt.”</p><p>The gadgeteer stiffened. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>The avia-ra took over from his partner in crime. “Unfortunately, we are. Garfreckt’s hoard contains the Blaster Prototype, among other treasures, and I find myself in need of that legendary weapon. The High Priests of the Sun have not taken kindly to my… theological criticism.”</p><p>“I suppose I can understand that. If I was going up against those guys, I’d want an ace up my sleeve. But what about you, Rami the grue? What do you get out of this?”</p><p>“Are you kidding? I wouldn’t be able to look at myself in the mirror if I turned down an heist like this. A master thief has her pride, you know!”</p><p>“Hah-hah!” They both jumped at the eerie, mechanical sound of Nano’s laughter. “I like the cut of your jib. Tell you what: how’s about I join your little caper? That way, I don’t have to worry about what you fleshbags will do to my beautiful inventions. And I’m sure Garfreckt has a whole planetful of arcane devices. He won’t mind if I take a couple home for further study, eh?”</p><p>“It will be dangerous, Nano,” Mekhet-Nu cautioned, “and no place for a shopkeeper.”</p><p>“Nonsense! I’m a gadgeteer, Mek. Danger is my middle name! Or it would be if I had two names to start with. Anyway. All we need is a plan. Or a very big distraction.“</p><p>“Distraction?” Rami asked.</p><p>“Yes, something big enough that an eternal dragon would turn his head.” “</p><p>I get the feeling you have something in mind.”</p><p>“Oh yes. What we need… is an <em>arcane warhead</em>.”</p><p>“Ah, good. At least it’s not something that will be difficult to acquire,” the avia-ra sighed, voice thick with sarcasm.</p></blockquote><p></p><hr /><p>A gnome tinkers at his workbench, fervently toiling with two precise instruments under a magnifying lens.

These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly well educated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.</p><p>   Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace. Some gadgeteers become absorbed in a particular problem, innovating and optimizing solutions for it alone, while others devise technological marvels wherever they can find application. All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.</p><h2>AIs</h2><p>A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.</p><p>   But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Creating a Gadgeteer","type":"text","_id":"egvQ3FAMpH9ja7oP","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img style=\"float:left\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/gadgeteer-l.png\" width=\"300\" /><p>When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Did you have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?</p><p>Also, consider which Prototype you’ll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit? Consider what this prototype means for your specialization and your character’s personality in general. Lastly, put some thought into your AI. What’s its name, and what type of personality does it possess, if any?</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level. For your equipment, choose a researcher’s pack and an antimatter dagger. Lastly, choose the Technologist background.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Class Features","type":"text","_id":"PEGEbcHGi4mFFjo7","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>As a gadgeteer, you gain the following class features:</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d6 per gadgeteer level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 6 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per gadgeteer level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Light armor</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Simple and martial blasters, simple weapons</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Alchemist’s supplies, circuitry kit, mechanist’s tools, ship maintenance tools, smith’s tools, tinker tools</p><p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>: Intelligence, Dexterity</p><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose three from Arcana, Data, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, Religion, Sleight of Hand, or Technology</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>A repeater and any simple weapon</li><li>(a) a martial blaster or (b) two simple blasters</li><li>(a) a circuitry kit or (b) a mechanist’s tools</li><li>An engineer’s pack and leather armor</li></ul><h3>AI Companion</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, you are assisted by an AI companion, an intricate data construct which lives on your datapad and possesses near human-like levels of intelligence. When it manifests, it does so as a simple geometric projection; otherwise, it is merely a voice in your ear, checking your reasoning and informing you of relevant information. Your companion can solve any arithmetic or strictly logical problem you pose to it.</p><p>   Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, you can treat the result as 10, or your gadgeteer level + your Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.</p><p>   Your AI companion downloads and integrates knowledge of additional subjects as you gain higher levels in this class. At 6th level, and again at 10th level and 15th level, you can choose one of the following skills to gain this benefit when you make an Intelligence check with it: Arcana, Data, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.</p><h3>Gadgets</h3><p>At 1st level, you begin to amass a collection of cutting-edge technological devices called gadgets. You gain one gadget of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Because your gadgets are powered by your personal power cell, no other creature can use them. If one of your gadgets is lost or damaged, you can fashion a new one for no cost when you take a long rest.</p><p>You acquire additional gadgets as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Gadgeteer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you have and replace it with another one that you could gain at that level.</p><p>Your gadget options are detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws</strong></em><strong>.</strong> If one of your gadgets calls for a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><strong>Gadget save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h3>Overcharge</h3><p>With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional die of damage to that target.</p><p>This ability improves as you gain levels in this class. You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice), 11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally, starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the blaster’s damage roll.</p><h3>Prototype</h3><p>At 2nd level, you make a breakthrough innovation with a prototype of your own design. Choose one of the following three prototypes.</p><h3>Experimental Frame</h3><p>You have developed a sophisticated experimental frame, a powerful exo-suit that augments your strength and shelters you from harm. Your experimental frame counts as heavy armor, which you can don or doff as a bonus action, and it also grants you the benefits of a life suit. You are proficient with your experimental frame, but no other creature can wear it. While wearing your frame, you gain the following benefits:</p><p>• Your size becomes Medium, if it is smaller.</p><p>• Your movement speed increases to 30 feet, if it is less.</p><p>• Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.</p><p>• Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.</p><p>• You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can’t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.</p><p>• When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.</p><p>• Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.</p><h3>Mechanized Autonomous Construct</h3><p>You have put the finishing touches on a @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.gcv0riOmF3lR0gvw]{Mechanized Autonomous Construct} (a MAC), which is a speciallyconstructed automaton piloted by your AI.</p><p>The construct has statistics as shown above, and takes its own turn in combat immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command your construct if it is within 500 feet of you (no action required). You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. In combat, your construct's actions are governed by its Combat Protocols, which you can switch as a bonus action on your turn. If you are incapacitated or absent, your AI guides your construct to protect you and itself.</p><p>If your construct drops to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled. When you take a long rest, you can repair your construct to its full hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to build and repair your construct.</p><p>You can integrate weapons and gadgets directly into your construct. You can integrate one two-handed melee weapon, two one-handed melee weapons, or a one-handed melee weapon and a gadget. When your construct draws an integrated weapon or gadget, the item snaps to its hand and it can’t be disarmed of it. Your construct is proficient with any weapons integrated into it. The construct takes the Use an Object action to activate an integrated gadget.</p><p>Starting at 5th level, your construct makes two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action with its integrated weapons.</p><h3>Utility Matrix</h3><p>You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cubeshaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of the following gadgets, which you can use at will:</p><p><em><strong>Cloaking Device</strong></em>. As an action, you can activate your cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p><p><em><strong>Flashbang</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p><p><em><strong>Forcefield Projector</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you can activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p><p><em><strong>Grappling Hook</strong></em>. As a reaction when you fall, or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a grappling hook at a target location you can see within your movement speed. If the target location can hold your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p><p><em><strong>Modular Gadget</strong></em>. Starting at 5th level, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget of your choice that does not have prerequisites. This gadget doesn't count against your total number of gadgets known. Alternately, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an upgrade for an existing gadget for which you meet prerequisites. Once you reconfigure your utility matrix, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Tech Specialty</h3><p>Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a tech specialty that informs your gadgeteering expertise. Choose one Tech Specialty option. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score<br />above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Bluescreen Protocol</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you have integrated a complex construct-disabling algorithm into your AI companion, which you can activate as an action. Each construct within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your Gadget save DC. On a failed save, a construct is incapacitated and its speed is reduced<br />to 0 until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Override Protocol</h3><p>At 18th level, your AI companion can upload a devastating virus to seize control of a construct. You can use your action to touch a construct within your reach, which must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Gadget save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, even if it would otherwise be immune to being charmed. While it is charmed, you can issue commands to the construct while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the construct completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Antimagic Pulse</h3><p>By 20th level, you perfect a cutting-edge device capable of producing an antimagic pulse (abbreviated AMP), a type of energetic burst that completely disrupts and disables magic and machines. You can use your action to throw this device to a location within 60 feet, which explodes in a flash of blue light. This device creates an antimagic field (as per the spell) for 1 minute centered on the device, with the following changes:</p><ul><li>The effect is a 20-foot radius sphere.</li><li>Magical technology (including your gadgets and blasters) count as magic items and are suppressed within the sphere. Blasters can’t be used to make attacks while within the sphere, and attacks with them can’t penetrate into it.</li><li>Constructs within the sphere are paralyzed for the duration, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</li></ul><p>Destroying the device once it is thrown doesn't end its effects early. Once you use this device, it fizzles out. You can make a new one when you finish a long rest.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Tech Specialities","type":"text","_id":"YwG6LzPWGjRZJQP1","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Gadgeteers tend to be well-read on a variety of subjects, from data structures and artificial intelligence to blaster mechanics and engineering, but typically put their finest efforts into a pet project of some sort. While working on other tasks, the details of their pet project are running in the background of their minds, slowly being solved and pieced together, while other work busies their hands.</p><p>With enough experience, the subjects of a gadgeteer’s hobby become their tech specialty, a topic in which they are as expert as they are captivated. Often, this specialty is coupled with an objective, a goal to be engineered. Gadgeteers will travel great distances to share research on their mutual specialties, exchanging breakthroughs and discoveries in an effort to achieve a common goal.</p><h1>Drone Jockey</h1><p>Most gadgeteers tinker with drones at some point in their career; after all, they’re compact, useful projects, with a limited number of moving parts. However, only drone jockeys take this to the extreme of arming themselves with a small army of programmed drones. By linking the drones’ sensors and construct cores, they create a more cunning swarm intelligence, distributed over the drone network as a whole. This swarm can act almost autonomously, scouting the area and defending the jockey with mechanical efficiency.</p><h3>Hivemaster</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialty, you gain a special drone controller magic item and a pair of drones. These drones can be any two of the following three: a defense drone, a medical drone, or a recon drone (see Monsters chapter for statistics). Your drone controller is linked to both drones and you can use your bonus action to command all of your drones at once.</p><p>     Your drones are improved in the following ways:</p><ul><li>You can add your level to the HP of your drones.</li><li>When one of your drones makes an attack, its attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</li><li>When your medical drone heals a creature, it restores 1d10 hit points.</li><li>Your recon drone marks three creatures it can see, instead of only one.</li></ul><p>You gain an additional drone of your choice at 6th level (3 drones), 10th level (4 drones), and 14th level (5 drones).</p><p>Your <em>drone controller</em> can only command three drones at a time, and only two of those drones can be the same type, but you can deploy a stored drone as an action if one becomes disabled. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can retrofit one of your drones, changing it into a different type.</p><h3>Sacrificial Dive</h3><p>At 6th level, when you are targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to command one of your drones within 5 feet of you to fly in the way of the attack. This attack targets the drone instead.</p><h3>Focus Fire</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, your AI companion takes direct control of your drones, aiming and firing them as you direct. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can command your drones without using a bonus action.</p><h3>Omega Drone</h3><p>At 14th level, as an action, you can combine three of your drones (a defense drone, a medical drone, and a recon drone) into a single omega drone. Once combined, the omega drone’s AC equals 10 + your Intelligence modifier, its HP equals 5 times your level, and its ability scores are all 14.</p><p>The drone can take all the actions of its constituent drones and takes its own turn immediately after yours in initiative, acting as directed by your AI. On a hit with its integrated blaster, it deals 3d6 radiant damage.</p><p>Your <em>drone controller</em> can't link to other drones while your omega drone is active. You can separate your omega drone back into its constituent drones as an action.</p><h1>Futurist</h1><p>As a futurist, you believe that artificial intelligence is the zenith of all invention. To engineer a perfect AI, one which is capable of inventing on its own merits, is to conquer limitless problems by proxy. After all, an advanced AI which doesn't degrade into a rogue intelligence could turn its vastly superior intellect to dramatically improving the world, innovating in ways organic minds couldn't imagine. Your experiments with neural networks and intelligence theory have steadily edged you closer to finding such an AI, and granted your AI companion newfound aptitude along the way.</p><h3>Advanced Subroutines</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your AI takes a more active role in assisting you, rather than merely chirping up from time to time. Your AI can run any of the following subroutines, and you can command it to switch between subroutines as a bonus action.</p><p><em>Genetic Algorithm</em>. When you take damage from a hostile creature, subtract 1 from the damage dealt. Each additional time you take damage while this subroutine is running, the amount you subtract from the damage dealt increases by 1, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. This amount resets to 1 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p><p><em>Heatmap</em>. When you have advantage on a weapon attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage.</p><p><em>Neural Network</em>. When you use the Attack action to attack a hostile creature and miss, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to subsequent attack rolls you make while this subroutine is running, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. You don't increase this bonus if you attempt to attack a creature that you can't see or a creature that can't be hit. This amount resets to 0 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p><h3>Novel Intelligence</h3><p>At 3rd level, you have vastly improved your AI's intellect. Your AI Companion feature applies its benefit to another Intelligence skill of your choice. Additionally, your AI knows all languages and can perfectly recall everything it has seen and heard within the last 30 days.</p><h3>Tactical Analysis</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can command your AI to perform a full evaluation of your strategic options and advise you of likely scenarios. Until the beginning of your next turn, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make, and the next attack roll made against you has disadvantage.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Recursive Deterrence</h3><p>By 10th level, your AI has implemented passive routines that scan for incoming blaster fire and ready you for counterattack. As a reaction when a creature within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature.</p><h3>Singularity</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, your AI is nearly prescient. As a bonus action, you can allow your AI to override your very movements, guiding your shots to where targets will be. For the next minute, whenever you make a ranged attack roll and don't have disadvantage, you can treat the result as being equal to your gadgeteer level.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Hardlight Architect</h3><p>Hardlight might well be the penultimate arcane discovery. It is a strong yet malleable material, conjured fully-shaped from energy alone, and it can be used to construct entire functional systems in a flash. Through hardlight, engineers and arcanists can spontaneously prototype new designs in real space and replicate these designs later. Hardlight architects recognize the monumental importance of this material and dedicate their ambition and creativity to mastering it. As you perfect all the established hardlight spells, you constantly dream up new, innovative uses for the material, awaiting the day you can conjure a towering suit of hardlight power armor to crush your enemies and intimidate your rivals.</p><h3>Hardlight Projector</h3><p>When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you construct a hardlight projector, a device capable of forming hardlight and shaping it to your whims. If the projector is lost or destroyed, you can construct a new one over a long rest for 200 gp. By using this device as an action, you can create a simple geometrical object of shimmering hardlight which must fit within a 1-foot cube. Whatever its shape, the object weighs 1 pound, lasts for 1 minute, has AC 10, and has 5 hit points.</p><p>Additionally, you can use the projector to cast the @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.CsNvRRgV7yDrKnZ6]{hardlight needle} cantrip.</p><h3>Hardlight Spellcasting</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can use your hardlight projector to emulate the actions of a spellcaster, enabling you to create more substantial hardlight spells. Your spell save DC for these spells equals your Gadget save DC and your spell attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p><p>You can cast the spells hardlight blaster and hardlight nails once each and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Additionally, at 6th level, you can cast the spells hardlight construction and hardlight gauntlet once each. At 14th level, you can cast the spell hardlight frame once. You regain the ability to cast each of these spells when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Lightforge</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can forge a shield, a set of artisan tools, or any melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, entirely out of scintillating hardlight. After 10 minutes, this object evaporates completely into light.</p><h3>Prototype Luxcannon</h3><p>By 10th level, you’ve perfected a stable hardlight weapon, which you can conjure effortlessly. You can cast the spell hardlight blaster at will and can apply your Overcharge feature to the spell.</p><h3>Transient Avatar</h3><p>At 14th level, you can cast the spell conjure hardlight avatar without using a spell slot or spell components as a bonus action. The spell's duration is until the end of your next turn. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h1>Mastermaker</h1><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/MageHandPress_AviaRaGadgeteer_final01.png\" width=\"228\" height=\"250\" /><p>Nearly all gadgeteers strive for perfection in their work, but mastermakers take this to a logical extreme: using the technology at their disposal, they seek to engineer away their own biological defects. By grafting gadgets and technology onto their bodies (and making liberal use of vect components), mastermakers gradually become hybrids of humanoids and machines. They are stronger, tougher, and more agile than their counterparts, but many would argue that their techniques are too extreme—too unnatural—no matter what the results.</p><h3>Thermalsight</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have installed a vect optical sensor in place of one of your eyes, granting you thermalsight. You can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. If you already had thermalsight, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><h3>Embedded Gadgets</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can install one gadget or a one-handed blaster directly into one of your arms. You can’t be disarmed of this item and you can use it if at least one of your hands is free. Additionally, you can perfectly conceal this item, so long as another creature does not inspect the metal plates installed in your arm. You can change which gadget or blaster you have embedded when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing construct grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.</p><h3>Carbon Fiber Skin</h3><p>At 6th level, you have installed a durable metallic mesh under much of your skin, and metallic plates to protect your organs. Your Armor Class increases by 1.</p><h3>Reconfigure</h3><p>By 10th level, enough of your body is mechanical that you can reconfigure your parts to improve your agility, might, or even intellect. One ability score of your choice increases by 2 and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.</p><h3>Construct Perfection</h3><p>By 14th level, you have achieved the height of construct superiority by installing a construct core directly into your head. You no longer need to sleep and magic can’t put you to sleep. You are immune to being charmed, frightened, or possessed. Additionally, the maximum for your Intelligence score is now 22.</p><h1>Nanoengineer</h1><p>While other gadgeteers tinker with machines that fit in the palm of your hand, your machinations are smaller and your ambitions grander. As a nanoengineer, you work with nanomachines, unfathomably tiny robots capable of massive feats, from stitching together wounds at the microscopic level, to forming extraordinarily resilient materials. Your machines might appear as nothing more than a small blob of gray ooze, but once set to work, their effects are unmistakable.</p><h3>Cutting-Edge Nanobots</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have assembled a fabricator which generates a steady stream of advanced nanobots, called nanites. Your supply of nanites is represented by a pool of Nano points equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your gadgeteer level, rounded down. You can expend Nano points to employ your nanobots in varying ways, described below, and you regain all expended Nano points when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em>Deconstruct</em>. As an action, you well up a mass of nanites in your hand and fling them at a target within 15 feet of you. Spend any number of Nano points and make a ranged attack roll if the target is out of your reach; you automatically hit if the target is within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage per Nano point expended as the nanites unravel it at a cellular level.</p><p><em>Nano-Hack</em>. You can expend up to 3 Nano points when you make an Intelligence (Data) check to hack a piece of technology, inserting your nanites into the machine. You can add 1d4 to the roll for each Nano point expended.</p><p><em>Reconstruct</em>. As an action, you can expend any number of Nano points to create a thin stream of nanites to repair damage and mend wounds of a willing target within 15 feet of you. The target regains 1d6 hit points per Nano point expended.</p><h3>Nano-Duplicate</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can use your nanites to duplicate the exact shape, but not color or texture, of an object you touch that can fit within a 1-foot cube. The replica is made of nanites and lasts for 10 minutes.</p><h3>Recycling Protocol</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you've programmed your nanites to repurpose material and multiply. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a melee weapon attack or your Deconstruct ability, you regain 2 expended Nano points.</p><h3>Nanite Weave</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action and spend up to 3 Nano points to stitch your nanites together in a protective mesh above your skin. These Nano points are invested in the mesh; you can have up to 3 points invested at once. While you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of Nano points invested. Whenever you take damage, nanites in the mesh are destroyed and you lose 1 invested point.</p><h3>Network Response</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your reaction when you take damage to use your Deconstruct ability, targeting the attacker, or Reconstruct ability, targeting yourself, spending up to 3 Nano points on either ability.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Gadgets","type":"text","_id":"aiq5PZjdKTpmKVhd","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>If a gadget or an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to gain it. You can gain a gadget or upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p><p>Your gadgets count as magical technology. You must have a gadget before you can select its upgrade. If a gadget calls for a spell or magic item which requires a saving throw, its uses your Gadget save DC.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.LrbH88oVniA2vVoS]{Adaptable Omnitool}</h3><p>This gadget can be configured into a number of useful devices, including the following:</p><p>     <em>Auto-Entry Device</em>. This device automatically attempts to crack physical locks or hack powered doors when set to do so as an action. Its ability check for doing so is 10 + your Intelligence modifier.</p><p>     <em>Rebreather</em>. You can start or stop breathing through this apparatus as a bonus action. When doing so, you can breathe normally in airless environments. This device also shelters you from toxic fumes and other airborne poisons. You can't talk while breathing through this device.</p><p>     <em>Scanner</em>. As an action, you can use your handheld scanner to analyze the electromagnetic spectrum around you. Your scanner detects the presence, number, and type of technological devices within 30 feet of you and can determine whether or not a unique construct or device has been present in the area within the last hour.</p><p>     <em>Taser</em>. This device produces a debilitating current of electricity when you use it as an action. Make a melee attack roll (attack bonus equals your Intelligence bonus + your proficiency modifier) against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. This damage increases to 2d8 lightning damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.2c86tKXyeZJ5TlSG]{Blink Button}</h3><p>This complicated looking device has a single large red button on its face. When you press it as an action, you teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied location of your choice that you can see.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.6cm1KOM8ptUdDU6g]{Bubble Projector}</h3><p>You construct a device that, as an action, creates a dome of force as if you had cast the spell geodesic shield. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.yHGV3oVTAe9ywt62]{Chronoshifter}</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p><p>When you use your bonus action to activate this sophisticated, spherical device, you temporarily distort time, as per the spell time stop. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.3Q71XG6p9jaXkIBD]{Death Ray}</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>\"Your 'death ray' is just a blaster which kills people? I have an axe that kills people. Does that make it a 'death axe'?\"</p><p> - Throg, half-orc barbarian who asks really good questions</p></blockquote></div><img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/weapons/death-ray-sq.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p><p>You construct a @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.RyRNeTOyQRyE79RV]{death ray} magic item.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.FOlKpp6Fo9SpgDrK]{F-MAC}</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 5th level</em></p><p>You integrate a set of thrusters into your construct, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.ciNPRwYqu5LoGS4R]{Feedback Electrodes}</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: Utility Matrix Prototype, 5th level</em></p><p>You’ve installed an electrical feedback system into your Utility Matrix. When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 lightning damage to that creature.</p><p>     This damage improves as you gain higher levels in this class. At 11th level, you can deal 3d6 damage, and at 17th level, you can deal 4d6 damage.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.dzfOOVOhIefeO1UM]{Flux Cannon}</h3><p>This gadget, which looks like a blaster ending in a series of lenses, modulates the temperature of matter. When you activate it as an action, you can chill or warm a 5-foot cube of nonliving matter within 30 feet that isn't being worn or carried to a temperature you choose. You can heat or freeze most matter to extreme temperatures, resulting in different effects, depending on the material: heating water to its extreme causes it to boil, and chilling it causes it to freeze instantly; heating wood instantly causes it to combust, and freezing causes it to become more brittle; heating metal causes it to glow red-hot and become malleable, and chilling it causes it to become brittle and shrink slightly. At its extreme setting, this device can normally cause a change in its target's state of matter, especially if used on a target for multiple rounds, but the GM decides the exact effects on different materials.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.bserl1hNTYkuRBW9]{Focus Aperture}</h3><p>The short and long ranges of blasters you use is doubled, up to a maximum of 180/720 feet, or the blaster’s original range, whichever is longer.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.c74jnpdQZisioqNa]{Gravity Manipulator}</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></p><p>This blaster-like device emits a soft glow from the center of its conical muzzle. While holding it, you can activate one of the following effects:</p><p><em><strong>Levitate.</strong></em> As an action, you nullify the gravitational forces on a Large or smaller creature or object weighing less than 500 pounds that you can see within 30 feet. The target is attracted to you and comes to rest in a space that you choose within 5 feet of you. You can move the target around you and choose its orientation on your turn. You can levitate a target for 1 minute at a time with this device.</p><p>An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw to resist this device's effects and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing.</p><p><em><strong>Repel.</strong></em> As a bonus action on your turn, you can violently repel, in a direction that you choose, a target that is being levitated by this gadget. The target is pushed 60 feet if it is Tiny or Small size, 30 feet if it is Medium, or 15 feet if it is Large. If the target contacts an obstacle, both the target and the obstacle take 2d8 bludgeoning damage. If the target's shape permits, it can deal piercing or slashing damage, at the GM's discretion. The target is then no longer levitated by this gadget.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.dHgjcIBkjDqMacmi]{Hologram Projector}</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 13th level</em></p><p>When you activate this device as a bonus action, it produces an effect identical to the spell mirror image, except that it only creates one illusory duplicate of yourself. This duplicate lasts for 3 rounds, then dissipates. This is not a magical effect, doesn’t require your concentration, and can’t be dispelled with dispel magic or similar effects.</p><p><em><strong>Upgrade (17th level).</strong></em> This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You gain two illusory duplicates, rather than one, when you use this gadget.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.fUqajIlyoJjJrOnj]{Hypnosis Ray}</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 13th level</em></p><p>This phaser-like device fires harmless swirls of colors to mesmerize a humanoid creature within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for up to 1 minute. While charmed, the target is incapacitated and its speed is 0. This effect ends early if the creature takes damage or if you use this device again. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this gadget for 24 hours.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.46mv8XiaSvsQrnja]{Invisibomb}</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></p><p>When you activate this device as an action and throw it to a space within 30 feet, it produces a faint shimmer, and then each creature within 60 feet of it vanishes from sight. Each creature within that radius becomes invisible, as per invisibility, for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.FVfhVR20SlZqyQUo]{Jetpack}</h3><p>You construct a @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.Uiqq2ldorBU5ifTC]{jetpack} magic item.</p><p><em><strong>Upgrade (13th level).</strong></em> This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can use this magic item for an unlimited amount of time each day.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.MzZTm9xG3wWjDrRE]{Jump Pad}</h3><p>When you deploy this rectangular device as an action, it unfolds into a 5-foot square panel that whirs with an upward thrust. Whenever a creature moves atop the panel, they are launched up to 30 feet in any direction they choose. The creature takes no falling damage for the first 30 feet it falls. The jump pad deactivates after 1 minute or when you collect it on your turn (no action required.)</p><h3>Magnet Boots</h3><p>These weighty boots grant you the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p><h3>Mega-Gizmo</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Utility Matrix Prototype, 17th level</em></p><p>You can use two of your Utility Matrix’s devices as a bonus action. These devices must each activate as a bonus action.</p><h3>Micro-Missile</h3><p>As an action, this wrist-mounted device fires a small homing missile at a target you can see within 30 feet. This missile automatically hits its target and deals 1d6 force damage. You fire additional missiles when you reach higher levels in this class: 2 missiles at 5th level, 3 missiles at 11th level, and 4 missiles at 17th level. You can direct the missiles at the same target or at different ones.</p><h3>Micro-Turret</h3><p>As an action, this device can be thrown to any unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, where it transforms into a Small stationary blaster turret, which has AC 10 and 30 HP. Reducing the turret to 0 hit points disables it.</p><p>The turret makes a ranged attack roll (attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) against a creature you designate within 60 feet of it. On a hit, the turret deals 1d8 radiant damage. You can use your bonus action on subsequent turns to designate a target for the turret and command it to attack. After 1 minute, the turret deactivates and must charge for 1 minute before being deployed again.</p><p><em><strong>Upgrade.</strong></em> This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: When you command the turret to fire, you can choose for it to fire an overcharged shot, which deals 3d8 radiant damage on a hit. The turret then overheats, and can't be used to fire on the following turn.</p><h3>Molecular Destabilizer</h3><p>As an action, you can activate this gadget, which looks like a blaster with a widely-flared muzzle. When you do so, it disintegrates a nonliving object you choose within 5 feet of you that can fit entirely within a 3-foot cube, reducing it into a fine dust. This gadget has no effect on metallic objects or magic items.</p><h3>Motion Tracker</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 9th level</em></p><p>You construct a @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.31qr85FYznDq9WWr]{motion tracker} magic item.</p><h3>Omni-Grenade</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></p><p>As an action, you can prime this device to release a blast of elemental energy and throw it up to 30 feet. You can collect and reuse the device after it is thrown. When you prime the grenade, choose one of the following effects:</p><p><em><strong>Fire.</strong></em> The grenade explodes in a scorching inferno. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 fire damage and an additional 2d8 fire damage at the beginning of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and none at the beginning of its next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Ice.</strong></em> The grenade explodes with a cryogenic blast of frigid air. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and its speed isn't halved.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning.</strong></em> The grenade explodes in a crackling electric burst. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 lightning damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and can still take reactions.</p><p>This gadget improves as you gain levels in this class. At 11th level, you deal an additional 1d8 damage when a target fails its saving throw against your grenade, and at 17th level, you deal an additional 2d8 damage.</p><h3>Orbital Superweapon</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p><p>You have pieced together a massive doomsday device, an orbital cannon, which you store in a pocket dimension for convenience. By throwing out a beacon, you can summon the weapon and fire it, as per the spell orbital hardlight cannon. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Overheat Beacon</h3><p>As an action, you can activate this gadget, which produces a signal that causes every blaster within 60 feet to overheat. An overheated weapon can't be used to make an attack again until the end of your next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again for 1 minute.</p><p><em><strong>Upgrade.</strong></em> This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: When you activate this gadget, you can choose any number of blasters within range to be unaffected by it.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.GDrafcZ5tGcyYxzd]{R-MAC}</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 17th level</em></p><p>You reinforce your MAC with high-density alloy bands. As a result, the construct has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.c-feats.XJZw0ZaOTjP3TtC8]{Remote Gloves}</h3><p>These rocket-powered robotic gauntlets fly around following your every gesture. You can deploy the gauntlets or retrieve them as a bonus action. On each of your turns, without using an action, you can command each of the gauntlets to move up to 30 feet. The gauntlets will automatically stay within 30 feet of you, as they become inactive if they ever fall outside of this range.</p><p>You can assume control of the gauntlets to perform actions at a distance. When you do so, the gauntlets exactly mimic your hands, allowing you to manipulate objects and technological devices, store and retrieve items, or perform any other action for which you normally use your hands. Controlling each gauntlet requires a free hand and takes actions to perform tasks as if you were performing them yourself.</p><p>The gauntlets can't attack, activate magic items or gadgets, or carry more than 25 pounds each.</p><h3>Ricochet Aperture</h3><p>Your weapon attacks using blasters ignore half and three\u0002quarters cover, if there exists a solid surface off of which to ricochet the shot towards the target. You can target a creature in total cover with a ricocheted blaster attack with disadvantage if you know the target’s location within 5 feet.</p><h3>Rocket Fists</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: Experimental Frame Prototype, 5th level</em></p><p>You have replaced your frame’s hands with rocket fists. The fists are ranged weapons with a range of 60/180, which use your Intelligence modifier for attack and damage rolls. On a hit, a fist deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage. When you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon or a ranged attack with a rocket fist, you can make an additional ranged attack with a rocket fist as a bonus action. A launched rocket fist returns to you at the end of your turn.</p><h3>Self-Destruct Sequence</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: Experimental Frame Prototype, 17th level</em></p><p>You’ve installed an explosive mechanism into your frame, allowing you to detonate it when you enter a special code as an action. When you enter the self-destruct code into your frame, you can specify that it detonates after 1 round, 3 rounds, or 10 rounds (1 minute). You can deactivate the self-destruct code as an action. The frame explodes in a 60-foot radius, destroying it completely. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can rebuild the frame with one week of work.</p><h3>Shrink Ray</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 9th level</em></p><p>As an action while holding this device, you can target a creature within 30 feet with the Reduce effect of the enlarge/reduce spell. This effect doesn’t require your concentration and can’t be dispelled with dispel magic or similar effects. Only one target can be affected by this gadget at a time.</p><p><em><strong>Upgrade.</strong></em> This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can use the Enlarge option of the enlarge/reduce spell when you use this device.</p><h3>Sonic Amplifier</h3><p>This device, which is fitted with several large speakers on its face, can deaden or amplify sounds within range. When you activate the device as an action, choose one of the following effects:</p><p><em><strong>Anti-Sound.</strong></em> A 20-foot radius sphere around you is rendered completely silent until the beginning of your next turn. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible within the area.</p><p><em><strong>Noise Burst.</strong></em> The amplifier creates a sudden blast of white noise. Each creature you choose within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage. This damage increases to 2d6 thunder damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.</p><h3>Spectrum Visor</h3><p>This visor has a single long slit, blipping with lights and sensors. As an action or bonus action, you can activate one of the following visor modes. Only one visor mode can be active at a time.</p><p><em><strong>Aurasight.</strong></em> You can see a faint aura around any visible creature or object within 30 feet that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. This detection can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You gain darkvision, which means you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Thermalsight.</strong></em> You gain thermalsight, which means you can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier.</p><h3>Spell Cube</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 13th level</em></p><p>As a reaction when a spell of 1st to 5th level that would affect you is cast, you can trap it within the spell cube. The spell has no effect and is instead contained within the cube. The cube can only store one spell at a time.</p><p>While holding the cube, you can cast the spell stored in it, expending it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell.</p><h3>Stasis Field Generator</h3><p>This device deploys a 5-foot diameter spherical forcefield around you as a reaction when you drop to 0 hit points. Until the beginning of your next turn, you are enveloped within this forcefield, which nothing—not physical objects, energy, or spell effects—can penetrate. The forcefield itself is immune to damage and you can’t be damaged further while within the sphere, nor do you make death saving throws. The sphere is weightless and can be moved while you're within it. At the beginning of your next turn, the sphere deactivates, and you are restored to consciousness with 1 hit point. Once this device activates, it can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Upgrade.</strong></em> This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can activate this gadget as a bonus action on your turn, placing you in the spherical forcefield and restoring 1 of your hit points.</p><h3>Tesla Mines</h3><p>You gain a set of three electrical proximity mines. As an action, you can activate and throw a mine onto a surface within 40 feet, to which it firmly attaches. If a creature other than yourself enters the 5-foot cube area originating at the top of the mine, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage and can’t move or take reactions until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half this amount of damage and can move and take reactions as normal.</p><p>You can disarm and recover a mine within 5 feet of you as an action. After 1 hour, a deployed mine burns out. You rebuild deployed and burned out mines during a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Upgrade.</strong></em> This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: A mine triggers when a creature enters a 15-foot cube originating at the top of the mine.</p><h3>Transmat Deck</h3><p>You construct a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.bqBMfwy70QoQ7Hk2]{transmat deck}</em> magic item.</p><h3>Universal Translator</h3><p>You construct a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.MltDSXOCJXVaueNT]{universal translator}</em> magic item and can also use it to read all writing.</p><h3>Version 1812 Multirocket Launcher</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></p><p>As an action, this device unfolds into a comically large multi-barrel rocket launcher, which proceeds to fire wildly in every direction while playing a grand overture. Each creature other than yourself within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Zipgun</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“If it's good enough to kill, it's good enough to overkill.\"</p><p>— David \"Psybernary\" Wynter, Gadgeteer.<br />brandishing a zipgun</p></blockquote></div><p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></p><p>You build a @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.sIra17FfFspEzI42]{zipgun} magic item.

Despite their reputation, few races in the ‘verse are quite as good with a wrench or as quick with a comeback.</p>\n<h1>Pragmatic</h1>\n<p>Orcs tend to be practical, common sense folks, who believe the best solution to a problem is one that works. Working with hardware comes naturally to them, partially because an orcish preteen can lift an engine block, and partially because they find something satisfying in tools that have a purpose and machines that work well.</p>\n<p>  Most orc technology has developed according to the, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mindset, which has led to some truly unique designs. Their ships, which they usually call “rigs” or “rides”, are powered by gasoline, and feature impressive exhaust pipes and air intakes. It’s not uncommon to see one painted with pinstripes, flames, or entire murals. Likewise, their blasters still retain the trappings of ammunition-based guns, with magazines and prominent muzzles.</p>\n<h1>Aftermath of War</h1>\n<p>While history remembers the Warzone as being the consequence of a great orcish war, modern orcs remember almost nothing about the conflict. Their old national identities, on which the war originally centered, have been washed away with centuries of arcane warheads and goblinoid alliances, and those few which can escape the Warzone would rather pretend it didn’t happen. They carry their history and culture with them, and feel a pang for the war that took their homeworld, but claim little responsibility for the violence of the Warzone today.</p>\n<p>  Orcs of the ‘verse have undergone a diaspora since losing their homeworld. A surprising number have ended up in the dwarven conclave as full citizens, and nearly as many have taken up residence in the Lakshay garrison. These orcs outside the warzone usually claim the heritages of their adopted homes, and are welcomed in kind. Inside the warzone, however, orcs live among hobgoblin warchiefs which would conscript them into battle, and gnoll marauders which would raid their homes. As such, their life is a migratory one, whether fleeing the violence or pursuing it.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/orc-final.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.uKF6vIN2UhNInVSo"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ktslxkevw8","color":"#000000"}}}

According to these sources, the Tower is always in the shadows, pulling strings and attempting the hide the truth from the people. The truth is that people know very little about the Tower, save for its secrecy and its fraternal nature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tower is, indeed, a secret society of arcanists rife with cryptic ciphers and esoteric rites. It traces its origins back to Terminus the First, the same mage (now lich) who established the Hegemony of Man and expanded its boundaries. Terminus ostensibly founded the Tower as a fraternal order to unite arcanists from across the stars, but its clandestine nature makes its true intentions hard to discern. The Tower&rsquo;s inner-sanctums are closed to those who do not undergo their esoteric induction rituals, its agents speak in coded language, and the highest echelons of its memberships share profound secrets unknown to all others, including lower-ranking Tower agents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tower largely concerns itself with collecting and sequestering secrets, forbidden lore, and powerful artifacts. Whenever a new arcane relic comes to light, agents of the Tower are never far behind, investigating any strange occurrences and disappearing, relic in stow, as swiftly as they arrived. Their response times are infamous, for agents arrive at incidents almost as if they were given advance warning; it&rsquo;s hard to say which is more paranoid, that the Tower might have to do with the dissemination of dangerous magic relics, or that they have a secret web of eyes and ears, monitoring everything, always searching for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the Tower is truly a conspiratorial network of powerful arcanists with a grand agenda, or perhaps, for all its trappings, it&rsquo;s more like an arcane boy&rsquo;s club, trading secrets and restricting membership to the select few. It&rsquo;s even possible that the Tower sees itself as acting in the galaxy&rsquo;s interest by securing powerful artifacts and spells before they can fall into the wrong hands.

{"_id":"UKNzTjV0fr8BSfhX","name":"Race - Amoeboid","content":"<h1>Amoeboids</h1>\n<p><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/amoeboid-book-sm.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"239\" /></p>\n<p>Amorphous, bizarre, and remarkably advanced, amoeboids are the very definition of alien. Encountering them is practically dizzying for first-time visitors to a maw: their eerily transparent bodies flash with dim organic lights, shapeshifting into vague forms and imperfect copies of various creatures, all accompanied by a strange hum of blurbles and tones. Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.</p>\n<p>  Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cuttingedge intersection of science and arcana.</p>\n<p>  Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply  discovered on the maws. Some speculate that the amoeboids evolved there among the advanced technology, but just as many support the theory that amoeboids were designed and purposefully placed on the maws.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Mystery</h3>\n<p>The universe has no shortage of mysteries and enigmas, but scholars have long agreed that the origin of the maws, and how the amoeboids came to inhabit them, is the Grand Mystery. After all, nothing so fantastic could be a mere coincidence; the maws are a ready-made transit network, connecting the far reaches of the galaxy, complete with a resident race of shapeshifters intelligent enough to understand them and skilled enough to maintain them. Indeed, most races would likely have never discovered Dark Matter technology without observing the maw stations firsthand. Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giants, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.</p>\n<p>   More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop colossal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable maw portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it’s unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?</p>\n<p>   For their part, the amoeboids have few answers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are as inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed “zero” generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.</p>\n<p>   It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear. Perhaps the Grand Mystery has been intentionally obscured by a powerful creator or creators, or perhaps all involved are missing some critical piece, some insight that links the amoeboids, the maws, and their enigmatic creation.</p>\n<h3>Expanding the Compendium</h3>\n<p>Before most races mastered spaceflight and journeyed to the stars, the only records of amoeboids were of bug-eyed visitors from another world, arriving by night in strange saucers to abduct livestock and flash otherworldly lights. Amoeboids were among the first to travel the stars (their ships derived from technology found on the maws), and they did so with purely scientific intentions: every alien planet, star, nebula, and creature they discover is studied, categorized, and detailed in a vast database of arcane terminals called the Compendium. This single database, a collection of nearly everything known to them, is a scientific marvel, a monument to all amoeboid achievement.</p>\n<p>   To this day, amoeboids are the only race that maintains a non-involvement policy in their visits to other worlds, keeping their distance, observing remotely when possible, and experimenting only when disturbance can be minimized. The sole exception to non-involvement is with spacefaring races that have journeyed to the maws themselves; the amoeboids greet such groups as equals, and welcome them with access to the galactic community.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Amoeboid\" data-language=\"amoeboid\"><em>“Another failed experiment,” muttered Yr.</em></span><br /><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Amoeboid\" data-language=\"amoeboid\">The amoeboid’s nucleus flashed dark red, his version of a resigned sigh.

He made his way to the next room, where a terrified human man lay restrained on a table, yelling incoherently. He touched the man and his shape changed, taking on more human-like proportions, but with a grossly overlarge head and bulging eyes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Amoeboid\" data-language=\"amoeboid\">   “Sorry for the inconvenience,” Yr apologized in the man’s language. “I wish I could repay you for your livestock, but we have rules against that sort of thing, I’m afraid. Now please stop squirming while I ready a memory modification.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Yr, amoeboid scientist, assessing a Void experiment</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Amoeboids are intelligent, vaguely humanoid-shaped, translucent oozes that can mimic the form of any creature they touch. These creatures tend to the maw stations, experimenting into the nature of space and time, parlaying with any creature they meet.</p>\n<h2>Fluid Anatomy</h2>\n<p>Amoeboid bodies are almost entirely composed of a translucent jelly-like substance, with a complex network of nerves visible throughout, which emit a dim blue light. Within their heads, a large, brain-like nucleus floats, surrounded by five eyespots spaced radially around it.</p>\n<p>   Their fluid bodies can take the genetic imprint of creatures they touch, molding into an inexact copy, visibly made of the same jelly material. When in this form, however, amoeboids can speak the language of their copy and move in much the same way, allowing them to empathize with virtually any creature.</p>\n<p>   No one is sure exactly how the bizarre anatomy of the amoeboids came to be, for they are among the oldest races in the 'verse and few accounts exist before them. The elves believe that their strange forms were created on a rogue world, flung into the Black by a catastrophic event, but the avia-ra maintain that their forms are a result of long-term corruption by the Void. There might be some credence to this latter theory, for those that are exposed to the Void's terrible lights and survive undergo the warp and are changed in drastic and horrifying ways, being robbed forever of their previous forms. Perhaps, it is possible that the amoeboids were warped so intensely they were left as mere genetic sludge, lacking any true shape.</p>\n<h2>Scientists and Mawkeepers</h2>\n<p>Above all else, amoeboids value logical thinking as a lens to analyze the world. They keenly believe that the multiverse is founded on an objective, concrete reality defined solely by magic and physics, all of which can be understood. All things, including the elusive mystery of the maw stations, can be unraveled with proper attention, experimentation, and reasoning. Most amoeboids regard no subject as taboo and have few qualms about any kind of research, as long as its methodology is sound and is reasonably likely to produce useful data.</p>\n<p>   Most amoeboids live on the maw stations themselves, researching the maw's activities, repairing ships and Dark Matter engines, and trading information with other scientists and wizards the 'verse over. With their keen intellect, amoeboids make excellent alchemists, gadgeteers, and wizards, and can find no better place to live than the maw stations.</p>\n<h2>Strange Visitors</h2>\n<p>Amoeboids have taken to visiting settled worlds in secret, disguising their saucers and themselves to perform experiments on the inhabitants. By and large, these experiments are noninvasive, but are nonetheless unwelcome. As a result, many worlds have ancient tales of strange visitors from the stars, looking much like them, but strangely distorted, who steal individuals away by night and subject them to strange rituals in brightly lit rooms. Amoeboids will also vivisect the odd head of livestock, but these occurrences are more likely to be blamed on predators than on men from the stars.</p>\n<h2>Amoeboid Names</h2>\n<p>Ever concerned with efficiency, amoeboid names can traditionally be represented by a single unusual character, to differentiate it from the rest of a particular alphabet. Amoeboids don't differentiate between males and females, nor are their names particularly masculine or feminine.</p>\n<p><em>Amoeboid Names</em>.

Additionally, A.I. offers swift, discreet travel services between over three thousand different ports of call, including every maw on the grid. If you need to get somewhere or find something, no one in the 'verse is going to do it faster than Astrogations Inc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The greatest problem A.I. faces is that, unlike terrestrial cartography, the &ldquo;topology&rdquo; of the &lsquo;verse is in constant flux. While some points (such as the maw stations) rotate about the galactic core in relatively fixed positions, there are enough spatial anomalies, rogue planets, and gravitational channels to keep a dedicated mapmaker busy for several lifetimes; this doesn&rsquo;t even consider the trouble of keeping the galactic governmental demarcations accurate and true. Even small changes in gravitational pull on a trade route could send a freighter plunging into a star, so extremely accurate charts are imperative.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To this end, A.I. deals in information of all kinds, purchasing star charts, planet scans, void jump data, and scans of anomalous events from explorers and spacers alike. This very information is cataloged and sold back to spacers to help refine navigation, dealt to the major galactic powers to define their borders, and used by spellcasters to accurately cast the astrogation spell, the company&rsquo;s namesake. Perfectly neutral in its dealings, A.I. will buy or sell from any willing customer, as long as doing so will turn a profit. The A.I. headquarters, located on Concordia, is said to possess hundreds of thousands of arcane terminals to store and collate its data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, A.I. has one additional trick up its sleeve to stay ahead of the competition: along with employing thousands of star-cartographers and information brokers, A.I. is also rumored to employ a staff of psychics, soothsayers, and oracles who attempt to divine the future of galactic movements. Long ago, A.I cartographers realized that, while the predictions of one psychic might be unreliable, the average of a hundred or more can yield consistently true results, even out to years in the future. It is even possible that A.I.&rsquo;s psychic think-tank has predicted more than just the future of galactic movements; that their psychics have divined great cataclysms that await the &lsquo;verse. Of course, if that were true, A.I. has remained silent on the matter, perhaps wishing to turn this information to profit in the future.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/astrogations-alp.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.zheauCALmlLteS8O"},"cf":{"id":"temp_1wcsmr9yxis","color":"#000000"}}}

This class can be found for <strong>free</strong> on <a href=\"https://magehandpress.com/category/content/mage-hand-press-classes/craftsmen\">magehandpress.com</a></p></div><p>A burly dwarf brings his hammer down on a glowing hunk of steel, launching a shower of sparks into the air. Sweat pours down his back, and his arms strain with each strike, revealing thick cords of muscle, yet he does not tire. The air resonates with the sound of metal impacting metal, while the bright, hot piece of steel in his tongs begins to take shape. Gradually, it flattens, widens, hardens, and cools. He quenches the newly formed blade in an oil bath, then sets his mind to preparations for polishing, sharpening, and fitting the weapon with a handle and guard.<br />     An elf threads a needle with an almost impossibly thin metallic wire, preparing to set the stitches into a set of what looks to be leather armor, but made of dragon's hide. She checks the placement and attachment of the owlbear down lining and ensures that her apprentice set the crystal studs into the surface properly. Once satisfied, she sets about her work in a flurry of dexterous stitches.<br />     A gnome with an intricate set of goggles examines the stock for his latest work, a portable ballista. He examines the gearing and loading crank, ensures the tension onthe bowstring, and scansthe bolt rail for imperfections. He smiles, for heknows his work is without flaw.</p><h2>Master of Craft</h2><p>Artisans of all types are an integral part of every culture: buildings must be erected, pots must be set to the kiln, tools must be smithed. Despite their pervasiveness, master craftsmen are still as rare as they are prized. These artisans, creators, and inventors can smith items of mythic quality, and can solve most any problem simply by using the right tool and the appropriate amount of force.</p><h2>Secret of Steel</h2><p>Adventuring craftsmen come in many varieties, but nearly all leverage use their advanced knowledgeof metallurgy, smelting, and construction to forge arms and armor rarely seen, even by other adventurers. The smiths test their schematics and designs themselves, building prototypes and experimental gear that can later be refined into mass-production items.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"zSIUHz6YCgpsCnHO","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"Class Features","type":"text","_id":"s0pGYE6X3d0ZOHH2","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Quick Build</h2><p>You can make a craftsman quickly by following these suggestions.

You are also proficient with all sets of artisan’s tools.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"smithy\">Smithy</h2><p>At 1st level, you carry a set of craftsman’s tools, a combined toolkit which covers the essentials of all artisan’s tools and allows you to add your proficiency bonus to anything you craft. It weighs 20 lb. and can be replaced for 75 gp.<br />     While using these tools to craft an item, you can make a day’s worth of progress towards crafting in the 8 hours during a long rest. Each day, you can craft items worth a total of 50 gp times your craftsman level. As normal, you must provide material equal to half the items’ market value.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"masterwork\">Masterwork</h2><p>At 2nd level, you begin to learn the deeper intricacies of weapon and armor craftsmanship.</p><h3 data-anchor=\"masterwork-equipment\">Masterwork Equipment</h3><p>As a craftsman, you are capable of creating weapons and armor of the utmost quality; such creations are known as Masterwork items. By spending an additional 100 gp in materials and 8 hours of work when crafting a weapon or suit of armor, you can create a masterwork version of that item. In addition, you can spend 100 gp and 8 hours of time to modify an existing item to be masterwork.</p><h3 data-anchor=\"masterwork-properties\">Masterwork Properties</h3><table><thead><tr><td>Properties</td><td>Craftsman Level</td><td>Cost</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>2nd</td><td>--</td></tr><tr><td>Journeyman</td><td>5th</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Master</td><td>11th</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary</td><td>17th</td><td>500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 data-anchor=\"masterwork-bonus\">Masterwork Bonus</h3><p>As you gain levels in this class, the masterwork items you craft will grant a Masterwork bonus when wielded or worn by a proficient creature. At 5th level, your masterwork weapons have a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and your masterwork suits of armor have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level, +3 at 17th level.</p><h3 data-anchor=\"masterwork-properties$1\">Masterwork Properties</h3><p>Masterwork items you craft can be modified with masterwork properties, advanced modifications which allow you to create truly unique weapons and armor. Masterwork properties are separated into 4 levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, and Legendary. You can apply a number of Apprentice properties equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Masterwork Bonus (minimum 1) to a piece of gear, and can apply one each of Journeyman, Master, and Legendary properties to a masterwork item.<br />     While anyone can use a masterwork version of a weapon or suit of armor if they are proficient with it, once a piece of masterwork gear has been modified with a Master or Legendary property, it is then fitted to your exact specifications and can only be used proficiently by you.<br />     You can apply any number of masterwork properties to a single piece of masterwork equipment over a period of 8 hours, which may be done over the course of a long rest. Each added masterwork property requires a cost in materials and can only be done by craftsmen of a high enough level, as shown in the Masterwork Properties table. You can remove or replace masterwork properties on an item in the same amount of time, though you must still pay the cost of newly added masterwork properties.<br />     When you learn a new level of masterwork properties, you canapply a property from that level to two pieces of masterwork equipment at no cost. Additionally, whenever you apply a masterwork property to a weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can change that weapon’s damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.<br />     While magic weapons and armor can be made masterwork, once modified with masterwork properties, they do not grant a masterwork bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, or armor class.</p><h3 data-anchor=\"crafting-ability\">Crafting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is your primary ability when it comes to crafting. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC when an item that you craft calls for one.</p><p><strong>Masterwork save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h2 data-anchor=\"tool-belt\">Tool Belt</h2><p>While other adventurers may rely on spells, or luck, or brute strength to solve a problem, you believe in always having the right tool on hand. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to retrieve a piece of nonmagical gear from your belt, apron, pack, cart, or wherever you keep your tools, even if you did not have it in your inventory before. This item’s price in gp must be no higher than 10 times your craftsman level. Items retrieved this way become lost in your inventory and vanish you take a long rest. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all expended uses following a long rest.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"artisans-guild\">Artisans’ Guild</h2><p>At 3rd level, you join an Artisans’Guild. Select one of the Guilds from those listed below; you gain the 3rdlevel ability of that guild. You gain an additional Guild ability at 7th, 10th, 14th and 18th level.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"ability-score-improvement\">Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"extra-attack\">Extra Attack</h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"folded-steel\">Folded Steel</h2><p>At 6th level, you discover or create new processes for making your masterwork gear even stronger than before. Masterwork weapons crafted or modified by you count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance and immunity.</p><div class=\"ddbimporter-image-container\"><blockquote><p>Crafting</p><p>The ability to forge and create items is central to the craftsman. To craft an item, a character requires three things: materials, tools, and time:</p><ul><li>In most cases, the raw materials for an item can be obtained for 1/2 the item’s price. This cost can fluctuate dependingon the character's current circumstances, contacts, or access to natural resources.</li><li>A set of the appropriate artisan’s tools and proficiency in their use is generally all that is required to craft an item, though occasionally use of a larger shop is needed for more complex items, and proper scaffolding and earth-moving equipment is needed for building structures.</li><li>The time required to craft an item is measured against its market value. Normally, a character makes progress toward crafting an item equal to 5gp for each day of downtime, completing their work when this amount exceeds the item’s price. As a craftsman, you work more much faster, and make progress equal to 50 gp ×your craftsman level each day.</li></ul></blockquote></div><h2 data-anchor=\"rapid-modifications\">Rapid Modifications</h2><p>Starting at 9th level, you gain the ability to quickly reconfigure your equipment to meet your needs. As an action, you can replace a masterwork property on a single piece of gear with any other masterwork property of the same level. You can’t replace a property that is a prerequisite for another of the weapon’s properties, and the weapon must meet all the prerequisites for the new property. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"craftsmans-strike\">Craftsman's Strike</h2><p>You've learned how to build, but you also know how to destroy. Starting at 13th level, your weapon attacks deal maximum damage to objects, and an additional 1d8 damage to constructs.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"uncanny-tool-belt\">Uncanny Tool Belt</h2><p>You have a knack for finding the most useful things buried away in your cart. Starting at 15th level, you can produce a single common or uncommon magic item from your tool belt. The item become lost in your inventory and vanish when you a long rest.Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"magnum-opus\">Magnum Opus</h2><p>At 20th level, you complete an object of unparalleled majesty. You can retreat into your forge for a period of 30 days; during this time, you are feverishly working. At the end of the 30 days, you emerge from your forge, carrying your creation: a single magic itemof very rare or legendary rarity. This item is tied to your very soul: regardless of type, you are always considered attuned to it, and no other creature can attune to it while you are alive. This item does not count against your maximum number of attuned items, and you ignore all attunement requirements for the item. As long as you are on the same plane of existence as your item, you can call it to your hand or onto your body (as appropriate). You can only craft a Magnum Opusonce.</p><header class=\"journal-page-header\"><h1>Artisans' Guild</h1></header><p>All master craftsmen individually learn the basics of smithing, leatherworking, woodworking, and other necessary disciplines on the path to mastery, either on their own or under tutelage of another master artisan.

Each creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC or take 6d6 fire damage.</p><h3>Shield Guardian</h3><p>Beginning at 18th, you've driven the final bolt in what will likely amount to your greatest mechanical creation: a shield guardian.

You can designate a collection of rings, necklaces, bracelets, and other jewelry you have crafted that is worth at least 1,000 gp as a suit of finery. While wearing your finery, your Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + 1 per 1,000 gold your finery is worth (maximum +3).

Originally, its use was limited to only arcanists, but with the invention of the hardlight projector, nonmagical craftsmen can fashion this material into weapons and armor that appear in the blink of an eye.</p><h3>Hardlight Armament</h3><p>Starting when you join this guild at 3rd level, you learn to forge lasting equipment out of hardlight using a special device called a hardlight projector.

Weapons and armor created by this ability can be exotic, but can’t be masterwork. After 10 minutes, this object evaporates completely into light.</p><h3>Photonic Fortifications</h3><p>At 7th level, you can you can use an action to raise a defense wall of hardlight. Select a space within 15 feet of you. Starting from that point, a number of translucent panels equal to your Intelligence modifier appear, which connect to form one continuous wall. Each panel is 5 feet wide, 4 feet tall, 1/4-inch-thick, and is tall enough to provide half cover for any Medium creature behind it. Creatures cannot move through the wall, though they can jump over it. The wall persists for 1 minute or until you dismiss it on your turn (no action required).

Each creature within that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, opposed by your spell save DC. A creature takes 8d6 radiant damage, or half as much on a success. The blast leaves behind a super-heated trail in the area of the line, which remains until the start of your next turn.

Despite laboring for months or even years to perfect their creations, seasoned maesters are always seen to be laden with dozens of magic items, attuned to a handful of rings, and carrying a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.DoSvjhRARhRqWZXg]{wand of fireballs}</em>, just in case.</p><h3>Maester’s Ring</h3><p>When you take this profession at 3rd level, you forge yourself a small magic item known as a Maester’s Ring.

When you do so, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of that attack, and you can apply one of the following effects:</p><p><em><strong>Burst</strong></em>. Each creature within 10 feet of the creature you hit must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC or take lightning damage equal to half the damage rolled.</p><p><em><strong>Chain</strong></em>.

While the traps do the dirty work, the trapsmith is free to lounge about some distance away, enjoying a cold beverage and dreaming up new, dangerous designs.</p><h3>Danger Sense</h3><p>At 3rd level, your experience with traps gives you an edge when escaping danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. Traps You are an expert in designing ingenious and lethal traps. Starting at 3rd level, you can craft traps and deploy traps, which are detailed in the Traps section below, using your crafting tools and a bag of trapsmith’s parts. This bag of gears, detonators, springs, and other mechanical equipment contains many of the parts you need to construct traps. You can deploy a number of traps equal to your craftsman level at no cost, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Instead of improving your traps independently, you instead refine the quality of your parts using the following property: Trap Upgrade Apprentice property Components Trapsmith's parts Any trap you build using your trapsmith's parts has a +1 bonus to its attack rolls and save DC. You can apply this property multiple times, once at each level of Masterwork properties, further increasing the bonus by +1 each time. Smart Traps Starting at 7th level, traps you deploy do not trigger on or target creatures you choose. Booby Trap Starting at 10th level, you take 10 minutes to conceal one of your traps from an unsuspecting target. A creature can detect a concealed trap by taking using its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check (DC equals your crafting technique save DC), or by having a passive Perception score higher than that DC. The first time this trap activates, it deals twice the normal damage. Rapid Setup By 14th level, you can assemble a gauntlet of traps in the blink of an eye. As an action, you can deploy three traps which all have a deployment time of 1 action. These traps can’t trigger until the end of your turn. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Master Trapsmith At 18th level, you reach the peak of your craft. You learn the following crafting technique:</p><p>Ambush Weapon Legendary property Components Exotic masterwork weapon with the Two\u0002Handed property By integrating the clever springs and clockwork of your trapsmith parts into your weapon, you always have a spare quick-deploy trap on hand. You can use your action to load any trap with a deployment time of 1 action into this weapon. Once loaded, the trap can be deployed as a bonus action. Traps Trappes have a wide variety of dangerous armaments to main and disable their enemies. Generally, traps are deployed by throwing them within range as an action and activate on some sort of trigger. As an action or a bonus action, you can disarm and recover one of your deployed traps. Deployed traps do not count against the total number of traps you can deploy. Unless otherwise specified, a trap occupies the same space as a Tiny creature. If one of your traps calls for a saving throw, it uses your masterwork save DC. Auto-Turret Deployment Time: 1 action Range: 5 feet Trigger: 1 bonus action This sophisticated device automatically lines up a crossbow on a target, retracts the bowstring, and fires a bolt. You can designate a target within 30 feet of the auto-turret by speaking a coded instruction as a bonus action on your turn. The turret then makes an attack roll (attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.) On a hit, the turret deals 1d8 piercing damage. The turret carries only 10 pieces of ammunition and deactivates automatically 1 minute after being deployed. Deployable Barrier Deployment Time: 1 action Range: 5 feet Trigger: None Though not a trap in the conventional sense, a deployable barrier is a simple, yet vital tool for survival in combat. This barrier collapses to be easily carried and expands to be 5 feet wide and almost 4 feet tall, mounting securely into the ground, when deployed. The barrier has AC 8 and 25 HP. A Medium creature that hunkers down behind it has three-quarters cover from the opposite side. Small and smaller creatures have full cover behind the barrier.</p><p>Two or more of these barriers can be linked to create larger walls consisting of 5-foot panels, each of which can be independently targeted and destroyed. Landmine Deployment Time: 1 minute Range: 0 feet Trigger: Target moving within the trap’s area You bury a landmine, an explosive with a pressure trigger, which explodes when a creature steps on it. Once a landmine is buried, it occupies a 5-foot-square area under the ground. If a Small or larger creature steps in this area, it and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d10 damage from the bomb, or half as much on a successful save. Each creature within 5 feet of the target takes half damage on a failed save. A landmine is destroyed when it is triggered. A creature can detect the presence of a buried landmine with a Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by your crafting technique save DC. This damage of this trap increases as you gain higher levels in this class. At 5th level, the damage increases to 2d10, at 11th level, the damage increases to 3d10, and at 17th level, the damage increases to 4d10. Man-Trap Deployment Time: 1 action Range: 0 feet Trigger: Target moving within the trap’s area This oversized hunting trap, which is affixed to the ground in an unoccupied 5-foot-square area, clamps down with sharpened teeth onto the legs of an unfortunate creature that steps into it. A target that steps into the trap must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 slashing damage and stop moving. Until the target or another creature uses it action to make a Strength check (DC equals your Masterwork save DC) to free the target, it can't move. Creatures of Huge size and larger can move normally, ripping the trap from its mounting when they move. This damage of this trap increases as you gain higher levels in this class. At 5th level, the damage increases to 2d10, at 11th level, the damage increases to 3d10, and at 17th level, the damage increases to 4d10. Razor Wire Deployment Time: 1 action Range: 10 feet Trigger: Target moving through the wire's line</p><p>This immensely sharp wire is fired from a special device that anchors its two ends in surfaces that you choose and pulls the wire taught. When you deploy this trap, you choose two locations within range as anchor points; the wire occupies a line between those points. This wire is thin and nearly invisible. A creature can detect razor wire with a Wisdom (Perception) check opposed by your Masterwork save DC. If a creature that does not see the razor wire crosses its line, it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Remote-Control Bomb Deployment Time: 1 action Range: 5 feet Trigger: The bomb contacts a creature You can use your action to deploy this rolling construct bomb within 5 feet of you and you can use your bonus action to remotely steer it using a second device. The device moves up to 25 feet when you steer it, and you see from the bomb's perspective when you do so. You can control only 1 deployed remote-control bomb at a time. If you steer this bomb into an obstacle, it explodes. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The damage of this trap increases as you gain higher levels in this class. At 5th level, the damage increases to 2d8, at 11th level, the damage increases to 3d8, and at 17th level, the damage increases to 4d8. Trigger Mine Deployment Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Trigger: 1 bonus action These throwable mines detonate when you use your bonus action to press a detonator. All trigger mines currently deployed detonate at once when you do so. Each creature within 5 feet of one or more bombs must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The damage of this trap increases as you gain higher levels in this class.

You’ve got a good arm there.” He grinned and flexed a little, puffing out his chest like some kind of damn Sepulcher Knight. “So? You gonna give the old man his map back then? Or do I got to hit you again?”</p><p>Rami knew that this small prison, tucked away in the bowels of the Solar Citadel, held only two types of prisoners: immensely powerful criminals apprehended by the Sepulcher Knights, and dumb thugs like this one, who tried one too many times to escape their previous jail. Moreover, one of the few things that might prompt an intervention from the bird-headed would be the death of a prisoner. She would have to tread lightly; loosing the full force of her power against this fool could spoil her eventual escape, or worse, cost her the map.</p><p>And besides, it was much more fun if they thought they stood a chance. Rami muttered a word and flicked her wrist, summoning a spectral hand to slap him full in the face. “Bold of you to assume you can.”</p><p>His smirk evaporated. “Oh, you’re real funny, grue, but you sure ain’t smart. You even know who the old man is? He’s a Scale &amp; Fang elite, they say. Got connections across the ‘verse.”</p><p>Rami’s yellow eyes sparkled. “Why do you think I got myself locked up here with him? He might have been an elite back in the day, but it didn’t exactly take long to… <em>persuade</em> him to part with this.”</p><p>“You black-hearted wretch!” the thug shouted as he threw another clumsy hook.</p><p>A few seconds later, he was sprawled out on the canteen floor and the rest of his gang were preparing to pile in. Clearly the old man had never stopped making friends. Every lowlife in this place seemed to have his back. Rami dug through her memory for a spell which didn't require material components. <em>Invisibility?</em> No, that needs gum arabic. Silent image? Rami doubted her roughspun fatigues would count as fleece. Aha! Sleep might do the trick: Rami reached for a pinch of sand—the Citadel’s floor held no shortage of that—and started forming somatic components.</p><p>The faces of Rami's opponents exhibited a mixture of confusion and concern as she enchanted the sand, then a brief flash of horror as the bewitched grains flew towards the corners of their eyes. Within moments, a half-dozen of them had drifted off to sleep and collapsed in a pile. Rami sensed her opening.</p><p>She darted forward, evading one thug and shoving another back with a gust of magical wind. One managed to hit her with a thrown boot, but the glancing blow didn’t slow her dash toward the exit.</p><p>To her shock, the door swung open and a trio of avia-ra wardens strode in, golden sunstaves ablaze with radiant energy. Wordless, they set about the room, smiting prisoners left and right as if putting down a full-scale riot. Which perhaps it was, in their view; this wasn’t the sort of dungeon that usually inspired its inmates to rampage.</p><p>As a brawl developed all around, the grue wizard skirted the edges, keeping out of the way as far as possible and relying on her agility to evade any attacks that came her way. It seemed that no more guards were coming, so if she could just slip past these three, freedom might still be on the cards.</p><p>Cursing her lack of gum arabic, Rami drew on all the tricks she’d learned in her many years of thievery. The well-lit canteen left no shadows for her to skulk through, and she could only avoid notice for a scant few seconds before one of the wardens cut off her escape. The other prisoners, armed only with plastic cutlery and futile rage, were quickly subdued, leaving Rami the last one standing, backed into a corner. The coppery smell of the glowing sunstaves filled her nose.</p><p>“Come on, feathers,” she hissed, “what’re you waiting for?” Though the answer was clear: she could see glittering fire in their beady eyes. They were savoring their petty triumph. Switching gears to plan B—fighting her way out—Rami bared her teeth and began forming somatic components…</p></blockquote><hr /><h1>Forward</h1><p>As a general rule, magic doesn’t exist in science fiction. Any spectacular event can be spoiled with a few sentences of technobabble, explaining away the magic answer and replacing it with science. In fact, this is a core tenet of many science fiction franchises, as codified by Arthur C. Clarke's immortal declaration that</p><blockquote><p>\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"</p></blockquote><p>In other words, magical things can always be dismissed with science.</p><p>When you dive into the universe of Dark Matter, you'll find that quite the inverse is true: magic has become so advanced that it seems like high technology. Those blasters are highly-developed evocation wands, that flying car is using a permanent levitate spell, and traveling faster than the speed of light is simply an advanced application of teleportation magic.</p><p>In Dark Matter, fantasy and science fiction can live side-by-side: the universe is filled to the brim with huge starships, innumerable alien creatures and planets, and all sorts of blasters, jetpacks, and power armor. It’s also populated with dragons, demons, giants, and strange alien creatures to be met and slain. Axe-wielding barbarians clad in furs can stand alongside machine-gun toting androids, facing down alien horrors on the deck of a derelict space cruiser; trinket-festooned wizards and power armored space commandos can plot together to take down a dragon that lives in an asteroid made of solid gold; and lute-strumming bards can perform and garner fame in every hive of scum and villainy on the outer rim of the galaxy.</p><p>At its core, Dark Matter is a love letter to our favorite science fiction franchises, and an acknowledgment that science fiction in general need not be divorced from fantasy. The best sci-fi, from Star Wars to Dune, is filled with fantastic elements: mystical space-wizards, laser swords, precognition, and unusual alien abilities, to name a few. None of them seem all that out of place in high fantasy, yet the two are irreparably divorced. Of course, the distinction is mostly an aesthetic one—sci-fi outfits its magic in sleek metal, whereas high fantasy uses glowing arcane runes. Dark Matter is our attempt to bridge that gap.</p><p>Somewhere out there in the Dark Matter universe, every conceivable world—from the medieval domains of wizards and dragons to the high-tech alien planets of your favorite sci-fi franchise—waits to be discovered. Your own campaign world is out there, too, perhaps blissfully unaware that alien starships dogfight high above, exchanging blaster fire for the fate of the galaxy. So pick up a blaster and grab the keys to a starship— the whole ‘verse awaits!</p><p>Your friends,</p><img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/mhp-sig.webp\" /><hr /><h1>Using This Book</h1><p>Written for both players and GMs, the contents of this book build on the core rules of 5th edition and transport it to the science-fiction genre. You can use these rules in your own campaign, whether it be in Dark Matter, another published setting, or your own campaign world. This book is a companion piece—an expansion pack—to the core rules, and as such, everything from the base game still applies, while the rules of this book are designed to be portable and optional. Use as much or as little of this book as you like with any other 5th edition product to bring your own science fiction adventures to life.</p><p>Chapter 1 lays the foundation for the setting, and should be read by GMs and players alike before delving into the Dark Matter setting. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 are rife with player options, and will likely be the first stop for players rolling up characters, with a special detour to chapter 8 for spellcasters. Chapter 6 outlines a brand new system for ship combat, to be read by players and GMs alike if used in your game. Chapter 7 is a bestiary of monsters best reserved for the GM's eyes only. Lastly, the Appendices contain many entertaining and useful tidbits for players and GMs, from plot hooks to character conditions.</p><p>We hope this book provides useful options and storytelling opportunities, whether you're a GM or a player, no matter what campaign you play. May you roll well, explore this book with good friends, and enjoy your journey.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"The Galaxy","type":"text","_id":"aepbOM916B8UreYn","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>To a terrestrial adventurer, the scale of the galaxy can be mind-bending and a bit frightening. It betrays much of what their senses tell them: the land on which they walk is down, the sky is up, the sun goes from east to west. The idea that “up” is in all directions, or that there is no constant “down,” or that your world is but a speck of the cosmic whole is antithetical to nearly everything they’ve ever learned. However, for those adventurers who can muster the courage to brave the starry skies, to strike out into the unknown, and to take their first bold steps into the night, untold treasures are there to be had.</p><p>The galaxy is where interstellar travelers spend their time, charting their way through the Black, the empty space between worlds. Facilitating their journeys are the maws, which (in conjunction with their starships) allow them to travel between stars and vast stretches of galaxy by jumping through the Void. From the markets on the maws to the inner workings of their own ships, they’ll come across an endless array of magical technology, from the simple blaster to the intricate Dark Matter drive. Equipment in hand, it is on them to find purpose, meaning, and potentially profit in the galaxy; there is a nearly endless amount of adventuring and exploring to be done, a wide variety of races and factions to engage with or work for, and plenty of deadly hazards to avoid.</p><h2>The Galaxy</h2><p>The Milky Way galaxy, located along the upper edge of the Virgo Supercluster, is a spiral galaxy roughly one hundred thousand light years in diameter and nearly ten thousand light years thick. Collected within this massive, swirling disk of stars, planets, nebulae, and other celestial bodies are all of the sentient beings known to exist in the universe. While most scholars assume that life, and indeed sentient life, must exist within galaxies beyond the borders of the Milky Way, such places are beyond the reach of even the fastest ships. For all intents and purposes, the beings that inhabit this galaxy are alone in the universe.</p><p>Regardless of this fact, few, if any, creatures in this corner of the universe (often colloquially shortened to “the ’verse”) feel or will claim to be alone, at least on a galactic scale. Scattered amongst the four galactic quadrants are millions of life-bearing planets of all shapes and sizes, housing quadrillions of sentient beings. Dispersed between and around these worlds are millions of space stations, satellites, outposts, and lairs tucked into the recesses of every sizable asteroid and comet available.</p><p>While many habitable worlds are either home to peoples which have yet to discover space flight or are completely unaffiliated with galactic alliances, most discovered worlds belong to one of the galactic factions. These powerful federations, hegemonies, empires, and loose conglomerates span the ‘verse, extending to their natural limit at the Galactic Frontier. Facilitating these massive alliances is the maw network, a web-like series of immense, interconnected space stations spread in concentric rings emanating from the galactic core, which serve dual purposes as both communication relays and jump-stations.</p><hr /><blockquote><p>“The Black ain't all that different from an ocean: it's enormous and filled with horrible things you can’t see.” — Keplar Birdbrow, Halfling explorer</p></blockquote><h3>The Black</h3><p>Despite the truly staggering number of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies in the galaxy, they altogether account for less than a fraction of a percent of its volume. Indeed, space is filled with an unfathomable amount of empty nothingness. This featureless, cold, and lifeless vacuum is often referred to by spacers as “<strong>the Black.</strong>” It is truly ubiquitous, for every world in the ‘verse floats within it.</p><p>The massive expanse of the Black is the single greatest challenge to all long-distance space travel. While travel between planets in a single star system is possible for slower vessels, to cross even the shortest stretch of Black between habitable worlds without faster-than-light (FTL) travel takes many human lifetimes (and even a few elven lifetimes). Lack of air, food, water, and light means that life support systems are essential for any interstellar journey, and to find yourself stranded means slow, certain death (assuming a rogue burst of radiation or a stray asteroid doesn’t speed up the process). While powerful terrestrial mages can cross a planet with a wave of their hand and a magic word or two, spells of that nature (such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV]{teleport}</em>) don't penetrate far into the Black, nor can similar spells that utilize planar travel.</p><h3>Dead Magic</h3><p>No obstacle in the Black is as perilous and impassable as <strong>Dead Magic Zones</strong>. In these areas, where the magic of the ‘verse has worn thin and ripped wholly asunder, no magic functions, including that which powers ships and drives Dark Matter engines. Navigation systems fail, life support fizzles out, and engines go silent. Finding oneself in one of these zones without a non-magical means of escape is truly a death sentence.</p><p>Though Dead Magic Zones might appear fixed in place on a map, their boundaries are ever-shifting and churning; they warp, grow, shrink, separate, and merge, all seemingly at random. The largest masses of dead magic appear largely static, but only on the scale of lifetimes.</p><p>Over millennia, through constant, imperceptible motions, they too move across the ‘verse, swallowing some worlds and releasing others as they move.</p><p>Worlds that lie deep within Dead Magic Zones are considered by many to be lost worlds, inaccessible and cut off from the universe. The gnomish homeworld of Nebellion is one such world, and as a result, gnomish tinkers have developed marvels of science that function and power themselves without the use of magic, even achieving Void-based FTL. To this day, a gnomish ship is the only means by which to penetrate into Dead Magic Zones and the primitive, magicless worlds within.</p><h3>Sepulcher Star</h3><p>Situated at the very center of the galaxy is a sight which has sparked transcendence, insanity, and holy crusades: the great <strong>Sepulcher Star</strong>. An utterly massive star—one which defies all logic in its continued existence—sits in a slow, orbiting dance with an equally large, tidally-locked black hole. While exceptionally little is known about the star itself, the avia-ra (as well as several other groups) claim that it is the holiest site in the ‘verse; the avia-ra’s holy city, the <strong>Solar Citadel</strong>, orbits this very body. Many of their oldest scripts (which contain some of the first written lore in the galaxy) state that at the center of the so-called Sepulcher Star sits the First God, the carver of the maws, the true creator of the stars (and of all creation), the <strong>Old Un</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, sophisticated scans have verified that some structure exists in the core of the star: a sepulcher composed of incomprehensibly strong exotic metals that can withstand the perpetual inferno. But this is not the star’s only mystery, for the Sepulcher Star is far too massive to be as old as it is; by all rights, it should have burnt out billions of years ago under its own mass. As its orbit closes in on The Core’s black hole, it sheds even more mass, and yet continues to survive. Within a few hundred thousand years, however, the star is likely to be consumed by the black hole altogether.</p><p>The fact that the Knights of the Sepulcher, as well as other individuals, can draw magical power through the colossal star also lends some credence to its power. That the Sepulcher Star contains something of immense might is unquestionable, but the nature of what dwells within the star is completely mysterious. Perhaps Old Un is a being of light and creation, retired in its venerable age to rest within the star, or maybe Un is a malicious creature of the Void, or an Old God of the Far Realm, imprisoned within the star until the universe’s end. Or perhaps the truth is stranger still; all that is known for certain is that Un is powerful and inexorably ancient.</p><h3>The Maws</h3><img style=\"float:left\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch01-maws.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p>Were it not for the maws, galactic civilization couldn't exist on the grand scale that it currently does. These massive, antediluvian bones are the remnants of some colossal and long-extinct breed of void beast, reinforced with ancient machinery and clutching a massive portal into the Void within their jaws (hence the name). These portals are linked to one another in a network, allowing space travelers to perform perfectly-controlled jumps between the maws, crossing the ‘verse with ease. No one is completely certain how the maws work, or who originally constructed them, but they have nonetheless become the backbone of galactic trade.</p><p>Discovering the maws was a catalyst for the rapid expansion and colonization of the galaxy thousands of years ago, and their importance hasn't lessened since. Acting as a rapid transit network for ships, which can cross the galaxy in mere days, the maw stations connect the galactic empires, act as a neutral meeting ground for intrepid travelers, and form the cornerstone of galactic trade. Each maw station is a vibrant, multicultural trade city and spaceport, playing host to creatures of all sizes and shapes from across the ‘verse. If something is to be bought or sold (legally or illegally), it is likely to be found on a maw.</p><p>Unlike most outposts in the galaxy, the maws are uniformly neutral. All beings, even those from far-off planes of existence, are welcome to traverse the stations freely, without fear of reprisal. Demons and angels may be found sharing tables in taverns, chaos beasts can be found haggling with contract keepers from the Plane of Law over shipping manifests, and the bitterest of rival races may hammer out treaties between their peoples in the main courts. Maintaining this peace and neutrality are two unique groups: the amoeboids, a caretaker race of vaguely humanoid, translucent oozes native to the maws, and the Order of the Sepulcher, a relatively new organization of peacekeepers.</p><p>Though the elves were the first humanoid race to discover and use the maws for their intended purpose, their creation and creator are shrouded in mystery. Only a few pieces of that mystery have been uncovered, the most prominent being the amoeboids themselves. Given that they are the only creatures native to the maws, they seem to be tasked with the continued upkeep and maintenance of the stations, and are especially apt to do so. However, the amoeboids' histories contain no record of their origins, or indeed, on the origins of the maws.</p><p><em><strong>Galactic Frontier</strong></em>. There is but one exception to the maw network’s absolute connectivity: the links to the outermost ring of stations are one-way, allowing transit out to this outer-edge of the galaxy, but not back. Moreover, the outer ring itself enjoys only intermittent connectivity between stations, with an almost 25% chance for a failed jump between outer maws. As such, this far\u0002removed swath of space, called the <strong>Galactic Frontier</strong>, is as unexplored as it is lawless.</p><h3>The Void</h3><p>At its heart, the universe seems to be built on the incomprehensible. Through different lenses, wizards, engineers, alchemists, and scientists all struggle to understand its fundamental mysteries, but nothing exposes their ignorance more so than the Void.</p><p>The <strong>Void</strong> is not a plane of existence like the Material or Elemental planes; in fact, it is very much their opposite. The Void represents the space between planes, the absence of everything, containing nothing—not sound, nor space, nor time. It isn't just dark, but completely dimensionless; an infinite pinpoint adjacent to every point in reality.</p><p>By entering the Void and traveling through it, ships can leap vast distances in the blink of an eye. In such a process, called a <strong>Void Jump</strong>, ships are warped to an infinitesimal size for the briefest possible time, from which they can take a step in any direction and hop across the universe. Greater jumps require more energy, but allow longer steps from the Void through the 'verse; doing so, of course, is extremely perilous.</p><p>Paradoxically, the Void is filled with streams of hideous lights, which filter in from the most gravitationally extreme parts of all other universes and planes of existence. Because the Void has no substance and is adjacent to all possible realities, only the most energetic radiation passes into it, all of which is antithetical to living things. Any creature exposed to the Void is irrevocably changed, hideously mutated in a process called \"the warp.\" To avoid such a fate, most pilots jump blind from behind protective blast shields, relying only on tenuous magical navigation. Even technological assists fail and are burned out in the Void; unless protected beneath a thick, metallic hull, nothing withstands its ravages for long.</p><p>It is exceptionally difficult to access the Void from the confines of planetary gravity, making in-atmosphere void jumps all but impossible.</p><blockquote><h4>Dimensions and Planes</h4><p>Even though the universe of Dark Matter is filled with strange and fascinating worlds, it is still possible to find oneself on the Elemental Plane of Fire or swimming in the Ethereal Plane. The various planes of existence can be thought of as alternate dimensions, different layers of the dimension that makes up reality. Some of these planes, like the Elemental Planes, can be accessed from anywhere, whereas others, like demiplanes and planes related to the afterlives of specific faiths, can only be accessed from certain parts of the universe, on certain worlds, or if other special requirements are met.</p><p>The universe of <em>Dark Matter</em> also introduces the Void, a dimensionless realm beyond and between all the other planes. It can be useful to think about the Void as being a baseline dimension; it represents what’s left over when all the other layers of reality have been stripped away, leaving nothing, not even space or time.</p><p>Generally, it is impossible to use spells like <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]{plane shift}</em> for an interplanar shortcut across the universe, but the Void provides a unique exception. However, void jumps are only possible on the Material Plane; the void crystals which power them are dangerously unstable and will spontaneously collapse if brought to another plane</p></blockquote><h3>Roaches</h3><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch01-roach.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p><em>Ocoulori Radavitis</em>, known to many as “<strong>roaches,</strong>” are 10-legged psychic insectoid creatures between 2 and 6 inches long. On their homeworld, prior to the advent of spaceflight, Roaches were considered a particularly insidious form of pest, able to leverage their psychic, possibly even precognitive, abilities to avoid extermination. However, since their discovery by interstellar explorers, they have become the single-most valuable commodity in the ‘verse.</p><p>When most humanoids eat a live roach, a mind\u0002expanding wave of euphoria and vivid hallucinations, known as “the mists,” washes over them. Most roach users feel like they can see hidden dimensions of time and space in the mists, as if a curtain concealing the multiverse itself was pulled back and all its secrets were laid bare. However, this mind-altering sensation is fleeting and lasts only for a few short minutes. Worse, it can be addictive and even psychologically damaging, especially with long-term use.</p><p>For unknown reasons, a pilot under the influence of these hallucinations is actually able to judge the length of a void jump and navigate it very close to its destination. This side-effect has made roaches invaluable for interstellar travel.</p><p>Roaches can’t be bred in most places, even with good nutrition and habitats. Very few worlds, which apparently lie along unseen intersections in the universe’s ley lines, can sustain roach life and allow for new roach broods. Roaches that are taken off-world promptly become infertile and normally die after about a year. Of course, only living roaches cause the mists, so trade of these creatures is extremely competitive.</p><p>The crippling psychological addiction isn’t the only downside of eating live roaches. Despite their size, roaches are weakly psychic, and can empathetically communicate simple ideas to creatures around them. Strong emotions, like fear and affection, come across most vividly. It is probably some psychic effect at the moment of their deaths that causes the mists, which explains why alchemists have been unable to replicate it. Regardless, more than one pilot has stopped eating roaches—and willingly endured the terrible withdrawal period— simply because the pangs of guilt had grown too much to bear.</p><h2>Technology</h2><p>The first bold steps toward galactic empires wouldn't have been possible without remarkable advances in techno\u0002magical theory and application. While, for eons, powerful wizards and sorcerers have been able to alter the fabric of reality, gods have had total reign of their own planes of existence, and demons, dragons, and all manner of eldritch creatures have leveraged their arcane might to bend worlds to their will, the common person has always had little to no contact with the arcane or the fantastical. In this age of automatons, interstellar empires, and pan\u0002galactic communication, however, nearly everyone enjoys access to some form of enchantments, magics, or artifacts.</p><p>Low level magics have become nearly as commonplace across the ‘verse as once were torches, pitchforks, and horses. While most people still can't banish a demon with the wave of their hand or rain fire down from the sky with a word, most have ready access to hardlight-projecting consoles, datapads which allow communication from one planet to another, healing apparatuses that work as well as any cleric, and other similar wondrous items. Magic, as far as the ‘verse is concerned, is no longer at odds with technology: it has become technology.</p><h3>Magical Technology</h3><p>Modern magical technology traces its lineage back to traditional magic items, which possess incredible arcane potential and wondrous self-recharging properties— benefits which are tempered only by the fact that their construction demands months of work from a master artisan and centuries of arcane expertise to devise. With the discovery and later exploitation of the galactic ley lines, the construction of magic items became industrial: disposable, standardized, and cheap. At first, these processes resulted only in half-baked imitations of magic items, but soon, the face of modern magical technology began to develop.</p><p>A common element found across almost all arcane technology is arcane batteries—small, self-recharging power sources, whose energy can be adapted to nearly any application, from producing bursts of laser fire, to levitating objects, to creating holographic projections. Most of the time, the inner-workings of magical technology involves converting this power using a circuit of arcane components, such as abjurators, evocation shifters, illusiometers, somati-cyclers, and conjuration processors. The end result is a finely-tuned magical effect, exactly duplicating the efforts of a skilled spellcaster (with some limitations), but requiring almost no skill on behalf of the user. This new style of item creation is driven as much by mundane artisans, scientists, and entrepreneurs as it is by wizards or sorcerers, which is reflected in their designs. After all, why spend weeks hand-stitching a pair of winged boots when you can hook a couple mass-produced metal shells and a levi-pulsor to an arcane battery and make a perfectly functional <em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.Uiqq2ldorBU5ifTC]{jetpack}</em>?</p><h3>Dark Matter Engines</h3><p>Easily the most integral part of any starship, a Dark Matter engine warps a ship and its crew through the Void, instantaneously compressing the ship to a pinpoint size for a fraction of a second and teleporting it light years through the universe. Such a process is called a void jump. Though often taken for granted, Dark Matter engines are the most fundamental invention on the galactic stage. Without them, crossing the Black to maintain interstellar trade, establishing inter-system colonies, or even just exploring the galactic neighborhood would be an insurmountable feat. Civilizations which can’t unlock the engine’s secrets never take more than a few steps outside their homeworlds, whereas those which discover it are greeted by the galactic community at large. Indeed, if the elves were not the first to discover the engine, the shape of the ‘verse would likely be very different today.</p><p>Each Dark Matter engine is fueled by a small amount of void crystal, which is harvested from black holes. The crystals, condensates formed from the particles orbiting at the event horizon, are extremely unstable, and much of the Dark Matter engine itself is dedicated to insulating its crystal from any shock or disturbance.</p><p>Though the engine’s power is normally generated in intense bursts for void jumps, even while passive, it creates a steady stream of arcane energy, which is funneled into various systems throughout a starship. The engine can never be shut down completely; it is merely put on standby, for otherwise its void crystal would rapidly destabilize and destroy the entire ship.</p><h3>Ships</h3><p>As the primary method of transportation around the galaxy, the starship has become a ubiquitous part of interstellar life. At its simplest, a starship is comprised of four parts: some sort of hull, a life support system, some form of cruising propulsion system, and a Dark Matter engine. That being said, the exact shapes, styles, and specifications of starships found in the ‘verse are nearly limitless, from the industrial, smoke-spewing orcish scrap\u0002ships, to the graceful curves of gnomish corvettes, to the hardy, angular hulls of dwarven freighters.</p><p>Though they were confined to relatively short distances until the discovery of the Dark Matter engine, most of the ‘verse’s prominent races have a long history of dabbling in near-orbit or inter-system travel. Early ships often combined the principles and designs of ocean-sailing vessels, primitive gliders, and flying machines, and used levitation magic to achieve the desired effect. While these early ships couldn't perform the all-important void jump, they were fast enough to ferry their passengers between their homeworlds and nearby planets or moons, laying the groundwork for future expansion into the stars.</p><h3>Blasters</h3><p>Somehow more pervasive than starships, blasters are go-to weapons for most everyone in the 'verse. At its most basic, a blaster is a handheld device with an arcane battery and a focus aperture, designed to fire a beam or “bolt” of energy when a trigger mechanism is pulled. Originally crafted in the profile of a hand crossbow without the limbs attached, the blaster quickly gained prominence as the premier weapon technology in the ‘verse: simple to understand, easy to use, and remarkably deadly, with the added benefit of never needing to be reloaded.</p><p>Far from the short-range prototypes first pioneered by dwarven inventors, blasters today come in a dizzying array of shapes, styles, and functions, though there are clearly accepted favorites. Moreover, blaster technology has been adapted for ship use, allowing an enterprising captain to outfit their vessel with entire batteries of guns.</p><p>While the old standards of bows, axes, and swords are still fairly widespread (especially on less advanced planets and among races, such as the Skathári, that favor traditional weapons), one would be hard-pressed to visit any settled world in the ‘verse and not find someone brandishing a blaster. Adventurers might favor other, more eccentric weapons, such as the laser sword and rocket hammer, but they'd be mad not to have a magnus or repeater holstered at their side.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Races in the 'Verse","type":"text","_id":"KiXcf0W41IYnaJyC","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Many humanoid races can be found on isolated worlds throughout the galaxy, which themselves look like a microcosm of the galactic community, with elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, and others sharing a single planet. Of course, it would be absurd for so many diverse races to develop on the same world; all these humanoids can trace their origins to different systems among the stars. In some cases, seeding new worlds with humanoids is a deliberate experiment or colonization effort, but most often, isolated populations of humanoids are the result of miscalculations in navigation or mistakes of teleportation magic.</p><h1>Amoeboids</h1><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/amoeboid-book-sm.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"239\" /><p>Amorphous, bizarre, and remarkably advanced, amoeboids are the very definition of alien. Encountering them is practically dizzying for first-time visitors to a maw: their eerily transparent bodies flash with dim organic lights, shapeshifting into vague forms and imperfect copies of various creatures, all accompanied by a strange hum of blurbles and tones. Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.</p><p>  Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cuttingedge intersection of science and arcana.</p><p>  Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply  discovered on the maws. Some speculate that the amoeboids evolved there among the advanced technology, but just as many support the theory that amoeboids were designed and purposefully placed on the maws.</p><h3>The Grand Mystery</h3><p>The universe has no shortage of mysteries and enigmas, but scholars have long agreed that the origin of the maws, and how the amoeboids came to inhabit them, is the Grand Mystery. After all, nothing so fantastic could be a mere coincidence; the maws are a ready-made transit network, connecting the far reaches of the galaxy, complete with a resident race of shapeshifters intelligent enough to understand them and skilled enough to maintain them. Indeed, most races would likely have never discovered Dark Matter technology without observing the maw stations firsthand. Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giants, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.</p><p>   More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop colossal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable maw portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it’s unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?</p><p>   For their part, the amoeboids have few answers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are as inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed “zero” generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.</p><p>   It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear. Perhaps the Grand Mystery has been intentionally obscured by a powerful creator or creators, or perhaps all involved are missing some critical piece, some insight that links the amoeboids, the maws, and their enigmatic creation.</p><h3>Expanding the Compendium</h3><p>Before most races mastered spaceflight and journeyed to the stars, the only records of amoeboids were of bug-eyed visitors from another world, arriving by night in strange saucers to abduct livestock and flash otherworldly lights. Amoeboids were among the first to travel the stars (their ships derived from technology found on the maws), and they did so with purely scientific intentions: every alien planet, star, nebula, and creature they discover is studied, categorized, and detailed in a vast database of arcane terminals called the Compendium. This single database, a collection of nearly everything known to them, is a scientific marvel, a monument to all amoeboid achievement.</p><p>   To this day, amoeboids are the only race that maintains a non-involvement policy in their visits to other worlds, keeping their distance, observing remotely when possible, and experimenting only when disturbance can be minimized. The sole exception to non-involvement is with spacefaring races that have journeyed to the maws themselves; the amoeboids greet such groups as equals, and welcome them with access to the galactic community.</p><h1>Avia-Ra</h1><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/avia-ra-final-sm.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"353\" /><p>The bird-headed avia-ra might almost be confused for humans from the neck down, but unlike the scores of nearhumans that pervade the galaxy, the avia-ra are unrelated to humanity. Hailing from Kemet, a harsh, desert planet, crisscrossed by rivers and lakes, they have always known an appreciation for the sun’s blessings and cruelties, which forms the backbone of their religion, inspires their arts and sciences, and informs their view of the cosmos. Their dogma centers squarely on their deity and holy star, the Sun Above, to which there can be no equal. When the avia-ra took their first tentative steps into spaceflight, however, their religion bent and adapted to the wider universe in which they found themselves. Suddenly, their Sun Above was no longer Deshret, the star around which their homeworld orbits, but a theoretical “true star” from which all stars, including their own, derive meaning. It was centuries before they ventured to the center of the galaxy and encountered what they consider the physical embodiment of the Sun Above: the Sepulcher Star.</p><p>  In those days, the Sepulcher Star orbited much further from the black hole at the galactic core, and it was definitively under elven control. The avia-ra soon learned from the elves that the Sepulcher Star wasn't merely a star, but contained some sort of supermassive construct within. Though strictly an academic curiosity to the elves, this discovery galvanized the avia-ra: in the heart of this star, near the exact center of the galaxy, was their Sun Above. Over the next few centuries, the avia-ra quietly bolstered and gathered their fleets in preparation for the First Crusade.</p><p>  This was the first of many Crusades, bloody battles between the avia-ra and the elves for control of the center of the galaxy. Each crusade was punctuated with the signing of a treaty, a respite from battle, and a consolidation of forces. Always, a surprise attack by one of the two sides reignited the conflict anew. In the Third Crusade, the avia-ra constructed the massive Solar Citadel in orbit around the Sepulcher Star—a holy city, built for the glory of the Sun Above and to deter elven aggression. In short order, it was seized by an elven sneak attack; ever since, the Citadel has become a flashpoint for conflict and a central focus for Crusades.</p><h3>The Night Crusade</h3><p>The most recent of these battles, called the Night Crusade, nearly saw the wholesale destruction of the Elven Empire. The holy avia-ra fleet, known as the Congregation, captured the center of the galaxy in a series of decisive victories and pushed the elves back to their home system. In this moment, the balance of the galaxy was threatened, and the elves struck a bargain: in exchange for their assistance, the elves would liberate the vect across their empire—a move which would eventually pave the way for vect freedom across the ‘verse.</p><p>   The culmination of this deal was at the Battle of Alden’val, where the vect fleet turned the tide for the elves, critically wounding the avia-ra’s flagship, The Prophet. The ensuing retreat made an opening for the Elven Forest-Fleet, which encircled the Congregation, spelling the end of the Crusade. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty Black, a document that quieted hostilities and established the Order of the Sepulcher to safeguard against similar crises in the future.</p><h3>Depths of Dogma</h3><p>To some, the avia-ra’s captivating dogma, high priesthood, and Congregation warfleet represent a light and peace in the ‘verse, but to others, it represents a simmering kettle, just waiting to boil over.</p><p>   In the past, the avia-ra have found little success spreading the message of the Sun Above to the established races of the 'verse. After all, their pantheons are extensive and integral to their societies; a monotheistic god has little place among them. Instead, the avia-ra have turned to primitive civilizations, especially those on undiscovered planets, with which to share their message.</p><p>   The pattern for their evangelism is simple: build a civilization on an undeveloped world, founded on the philosophy of their solar religion, reside with it long enough to ensure it leaves a lasting legacy, and depart once again for the stars. In the avia-ra religion, all worship of the sun is indirectly worship of the Sun Above, so any evolution their gods of light and flame take on with the passing of centuries is inconsequential; they are still effigies of Old Un in the Sepulcher Star.</p><p>   This practice is controversial, to say the least. Many worlds have ancient tales of travelers from other worlds, bringing with them the blessings of the Sun, and these depictions paint them much like gods themselves. Humans, especially, have a sore spot for this sort of unfair proselytizing—High Terra was an early target for avia-ra evangelists. Elves and dwarves hold their own pantheons as sacred, and condemn avia-ra missionaries as a whole, but there is little that the galactic community can do, short of inciting galactic war. Thus, avia-ra evangelism occupies an uncomfortable, but tolerated position in the galaxy.</p><h1>Dwarves</h1><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/dwarf-finish-sm.webp\" width=\"306\" height=\"250\" /><p>Gruff, inventive, and stalwart, the dwarves of the ‘verse are nearly identical to those living planetside. Despite spending most of their time in massive fleets of mining and war ships, star dwarves are just as comfortable in the bowels of a mountain as their terrestrial brethren. Indeed, the dwarves who make up the Galactic Dwarven Conclave know that the biggest and richest mountains to be mined are, in fact, asteroids drifting aimlessly through the Black.</p><p>   While terrestrial dwarves deviate into distinct branches based on familial lines, star dwarves, especially those from their homeworld of Jormund, take on traits which make them sturdier than their terrestrial brethren. The high gravity of their homeworld strengthens their bones and ensures their short, stocky stature, and a life spent doing industrial labor toughens their muscles into steel.</p><p>   Dwarven expansion into space took a somewhat different route than most, in that there was little in the way of war or conquest. Ages before they discovered spaceflight, the dwarves had already founded the beginnings of the Conclave, which drove the interests of their entire race forward under one banner. When they began expanding out into the galaxy at large, they found that, although Jormund was host to all manner of life, the surrounding systems were barren. What they lacked in inhabitants, however, they made up for in mineral wealth. True to their nature, the dwarves turned their skill, magic, and technology towards the mining of these planets, and converted the influx of material into the largest mining and freighting fleet in the galaxy. To this day, no other interstellar race can match the raw material wealth or manufacturing skill of the dwarves, a fact which the Conclave would like to ensure.</p><h3>The Granite Throne</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Star Dwarf</h4><p>Star dwarves hail from the dwarven homeworld of Jormund and its associated colonies. They are tough and stout, with a low stature caused by the high gravity of their worlds. Living most of their lives underground or inside ships, these dwarves are pale-skinned and often grow stark white beards. Star dwarves are taught the principles of ship design and engineering from an early age and are among the finest shipwrights in the ‘verse.</p><p>Star dwarves are a subrace of dwarves with the following statistics</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>. Your Strength score increases by 2.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your speed isn't reduced in high gravity or extreme gravity.</p><p><strong>Dwarven Engineering Training</strong>. You have proficiency with the Technology skill and with ship maintenance tools.</p></div><p>From the outside, Jormund, the second of three planets orbiting the star Jotun, seems like the least likely place to find a thriving race of people: it is a desolate ball of rock, pockmarked with craters, nearly devoid of atmosphere, and constantly blasted by radiation. Just below this stark surface, though, Jormund teems with life, not the least of which are the dwarves themselves.</p><p>The oldest dwarven records recall that Jormund once flourished with surface life. Eons ago, long before the dwarves fashioned their first ships from mountains and rockets, a great cataclysm befell the planet, forcing life on the planet to flee underground. The details of the old cataclysm are lost to time, for conflicting stories tell of different disasters, from a war caused by the greed of an ancient dwarven king, to the folly of an invention crafted by a mad blacksmith, to the poisonous breath of a spiteful dragon which contaminated the skies.</p><p>   Despite being sequestered away under the surface, the subterranean dwarven cities are true marvels of engineering. Their tunnels stretch deep into the planet, some reaching nearly to its core. The highest cities, which reach the surface itself are full of brisk winds and titanic granite stonework, while the lowest cities, nestled in artificially-cooled pockets within molten rock, are humid places of stunning obsidian towers. Indeed, within its rocky caverns and carved halls, the planet’s interior, called the <strong>Granite Throne</strong>, can house nearly every inhabitant of dwarven space. This becomes a requirement at least once a generation, as each dwarf dedicated to the Conclave makes the journey home to elect two of their elders to supreme leadership, that of the Matriarch and the Patriarch.</p><h3>The Adamantine Fleet</h3><p>Despite their peaceful expansion to the stars, dwarves retain every ounce of their legendary ruggedness, their love of strong drink, and their fury in battle. Dwarven soldiers and smiths are held in high regard across the ‘verse as potential mercenaries or crew members⁠—many even think having a dwarf aboard is good luck. Dwarven spacecraft are praised just as highly: the Adamantine Fleet may not be as large as the Hegemony Armada nor as swift as an Elven Forest-Fleet, but its ships are nearly impossible to destroy. Coupled with the dwarven tendency to experiment with explosives, even a single dwarven ship can make for an astonishingly frightening foe.</p><h1>Elves</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Star Elf</h4><p>Star elves are pristine, elegant creatures, hailing from the Etilion system. Though nearly identical at birth, young star elves undergo a ritualistic Rite of Naming, which transmutes their bodies to mimic the ancestral elven subraces: High Elves, Wood Elves, Fey Elves, and Drow. These subraces are as follows:</p><h4>Star High Elf</h4><p>High elves are nearly identical to their terrestrial cousins and use the High Elf subrace.</p><h4>Star Wood Elf</h4><p>Wood elves are foresters and craftsmen, responsible for growing titanic ironwood trees and shaping them into living elven tree-ships. <br /><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1. <br /><strong>Star Elf Weapon Training.</strong> You have proficiency with the laser halfsword, laser sword, photonic lash, and swarm pistol. <br /><strong>Fleet Feet.</strong> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.<br /><strong>Ironwood Shipwright.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Piloting skill and with ship maintenance tools.</p><h4>Star Fey Elf</h4><p>Mystics and arcanists, fey elves demonstrate a connection to the Feywild, the dimension of unbridled magic from which elves originate. <br /><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 1. <br /><strong>Traditional Elf Weapon Training.</strong> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p><p><strong>Academic Interest.</strong> You gain proficiency in your choice of Arcana, Data, or Technology.<br /><strong>Fey Arcana.</strong> You know the minor illusion cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the misty step spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><h4>Star Drow</h4><p>Spymasters for the Elven Empire, drow are trained in all manner of subtlety and subterfuge. <br /><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 1. <br /><strong>Star Elf Weapon Training.</strong> You have proficiency with the laser halfsword, laser sword, photonic lash, and swarm pistol. <br /><strong>Nocturnal Vision.</strong> Your drow eyes are accustomed to the dark planet, Siink. Your darkvision has a radius of 90 feet. However, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight while you are in bright light. <br /><strong>Covert.</strong> When you are hidden and a creature discovers you with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check, you can reattempt your Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide. On a success, you silently reposition yourself and the creature does not notice you. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. <br /><strong>Drow Subtlety.</strong> Whenever you are hiding, concealing a weapon, or attempting any other action which is contested by a creature’s passive Perception score, you can subtract 5 from their score.</p><h4>Houseless</h4><p>Houseless elves, which do not undergo the Rite of Naming, are considered half-elves and use those statistics</p></div><p>Among the oldest and longest-lived races in the ‘verse, elves were the first to harness their magical skill to extend their reach to the stars above. Svelte, stately, and regal to a fault, elves often view themselves as the true masters of the galaxy, a perspective which has sparked innumerable conflicts in ages past. While they are not physically much different from terrestrial elves (save for their tremendously long lifespans), elves of the ‘verse are often referred to as “Star Elves” due to their wildly different outlook and their connection to the great stellar houses.</p><p>   Unlike the elven races of more isolated worlds, star elves are not split down genetic or racial lines; rather, they have deliberately self-separated into fantastically prominent Great Houses, or families, each of which claims sole residence of one of the planets in the elven home system. These separate families modify themselves to assume the traits of traditional elven subraces. In this way, even though star elves long ago homogenized to a single appearance, every variation of elf can still be found among their ranks. Their austere focus on house and family, while unifying, has also led to notoriously strict traditions regarding naming, relationships, and procreation.</p><h3>Rise of an Empire</h3><p>Of all the major galactic alliances, the Elven Empire holds the largest territory. Hundreds of life-bearing systems and thousands of planets live under their rule, each a mirror of the glory that is the homeworld. While orderly, well maintained, and generally free of pirates and other ne’erdo-wells, elven imperial space is often regarded as stifling and still dangerous for most non-elven spacers.</p><p>   To those that cross into elven space, adherence to the law of the throne is paramount. While the High Elves of Deuxcator are celebrated as masterful negotiators and diplomats, they are also decried for their iron-fisted rule and brutal censorship. The last thing any free spacer wishes on an enemy is a trip to an elven prison colony.</p><p>   In a surprising turn, vect are allowed both complete autonomy and full citizenship on any world in the empire, a lingering gesture of thanks for their support during the Night Crusade. It is not a gift most vect take up fully, but it has generated much goodwill between the races since the war.</p><h3>The Rite of Naming</h3><p>All elves of the empire proper are born or reared on Uneara, second planet in the Etilion system. During the first hundred years of their lives, “newborn” elves are taught the ways and traditions of their people—educated in all manner of magic, sciences, art, combat, and other properly-elven studies. In addition, they are rigorously tested and sorted into the elven Great House best suited for their particular talents.</p><p>By tradition, the Rite of Naming also adapts elves for their house by means of a series of powerful transmutation spells. Ostensibly, these spells are meant only to imbue a physical change on the elves’ skin, returning their appearances to the traditional elven ancestors from each of the Etilion planets, but in practice, it helps cement elves into their houses for the rest of their days.</p><p><em>High Elves</em>. Those who display aptitude in the magical arts, rhetoric, and diplomacy, in addition to exuding lordly manner, enter the great house Mala’Fiil, and may take up residence on Deuxcator, third planet in the Etilion system. Deuxcator is the seat of power for the elven empire, and all emperors and empresses of the empire have been of Great House Mala’Fiil. Furthermore, Deuxcator is home to the Elven War College and is the center of the empire’s military might. Elves in this house are normally referred to as High Elves.</p><p>   <em>Wood Elves</em>. Those displaying scientific aptitude in addition to an inborn connection to nature are named to Great House Molo’tak and are moved to Troisha, fourth planet in the Etilion system. Here, these Wood Elves are taught the secrets of growing and carving the empire’s Forest-Fleet of tree-ships from colossal ironwood trees. While the empire has many other worlds from which it supplies its fleet, the greatest of its shipyards is the whole of Troisha.</p><p><em>   Fey Elves</em>. Elves talented in high magics and deemed to have a connection to the Feywild, the realm from which elvenkind originated, are named to Great House Mere’gaal. Carto, sixth planet in the Etilion system houses these Fey Elves and the empire's grand libraries and magical vaults. While all star elves are naturally gifted in magic, the fey elves of Carto have the natural advantage of living on a homeworld that directly intersects a galactic ley line, greatly enhancing their powers.</p><p><em>   Drow</em>. Lastly, those who exhibit a talent for subterfuge, stealth, and shadow magics are named to Great House Miri’tesh, and given home on Siink, the ninth and furthest planet from the Etilion sun. The Rite of Naming induces incredible changes in elves of House Miri’tesh, darkening their skin to jet-black and bleaching their hair to ivory white. Outside elven space, most refer to them as Drow, though that name carries no meaning in the empire. The dark elves of Miri’tesh serve as the empire’s spymasters, assassins, and shock troopers, as well as deep space exploration and tracking experts.</p><p>   <em>Houseless</em>. Despite the total commitment expected of each and every elf to the Empire and their house, there are those who choose to break from their familial lines and never undergo the Rite of Naming. In the end, the same fate lies in store for each: total servitude to the other houses as a Houseless, exile from elven space if their servitude is not absolute, and death if exile is refused.</p><p>   Due to the strictness of the House system, breeding amongst the elves is a highly controlled affair. New elves may only be conceived and born on appropriate worlds in elven space, and must be transported within 10 years of their birth to Uneara for schooling and assessment, lest they be cast out. Children born outside these confines are either torn from their families and consigned as Houseless or are purged from the empire; the same is true of half-elves and planetouched born in elven space. Those isolated elves who are found native to a colonized elven world are sorted and sent to their respective new homes for a minimum of 50 years before being integrated into star elf society, or are purged if they refuse.</p><img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/elven-ship.webp\" /><hr /><h1>Gnomes</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Star Gnomes</h4><p>Star gnomes born aboard the Flotilla or on Nebillion are consistently gifted scientists and engineers, with an inborn eye for details and a knack for innovation. <br /><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1. <br /><strong>Retro Technology.</strong> Whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check to identify old magical technology, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply. <br /><strong>Engineer.</strong> You gain proficiency with circuitry kits. Using this kit, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct an improvised piece of magical technology. You can build a flashlight, a comm set, or an igniter. The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have one improvised device at a time.</p></div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/gnome-welder-sm.webp\" width=\"328\" height=\"250\" /><p>Unique amongst the galactic races, the star gnomes give the galaxy a glimpse of what can be achieved without the crutch of magic. While fundamentally the same as terrestrial gnomes, star gnomes evolved on a world deep within a Dead Magic Zone; as such, they propelled themselves to both space and to galactic significance using technology alone, a testament to gnomish intellect and their boundless curiosity.</p><p>   Indeed, most star gnomes today tend to be skeptical of magic and standoffish with magical races, or at worst, hostile towards its practitioners. Few gnomes have come to accept magic as a part of daily life, even with generations of experience, and most prefer to continue enhancing and refining their technology.</p><h3>A World Without Magic</h3><p>While by no means a new race, the gnomes of Nebellion are one of the younger starfaring races. As their world is isolated within a Dead Magic Zone, the gnomes came to rely on their own ingenuity, instead of magical tricks, to cultivate their world. With time, gnomes developed an adept discipline founded on logical reasoning and manipulating nonmagical forces, which they call science. This science is the foundation of all gnomish technology, which is wholly independent from magic and can function without hindrance in Dead Magic Zones.</p><p>   Naturally drawn to the underground, the gnomes transformed the caves and mountains of Nebellion into grand, glittering cities, packed with mechanical marvels of every variety. Eventually, the great spires of the undercities burst forth from the ground, and continued to grow like blades of grass wrought from steel and glass; now, there is little of Nebellion’s surface that isn’t covered by cityscape. While Nebellion’s environment hasn't suffered with the gnome’s expansion (freedom from reliance on burnable fuels being an early accomplishment of gnome tinkers), living space has become a premium. It was a search for this resource that led to their expansion into the stars.</p><h3>The Silver Disc</h3><p>Remarkably, nearly two decades before the gnomes first launched into space, they discovered that they had not been the first intelligent life on their homeworld. Embedded deep below the surface of Nebellion, gnomish explorers discovered what appeared to be a city-sized disc made of unknown metals, filled not with scientific marvels, but nonfunctional arcane devices. They also discovered the burnt-out remnants of a Dark Matter engine, and from there proceeded to reverse-engineer their way into the stars. Despite the fact that most of the enchanted objects (including those which seem to be recordings or record keepers) located on the vessel were intact, years of testing yielded no results; no form of gnomish power could cause them to spring to life, and even re-introduction to magic outside the Dead Magic Zone proved fruitless. To this day, it remains a mystery as to who landed on Nebellion, how long ago they landed, and how they traversed the Zone with such a vessel.</p><p>   What isn't a mystery is the effect the disc’s discovery had on gnomish society. Within fifteen years, the Traversal Guild had managed to create a functioning, low-class Dark Matter engine powered by fuel sources known to them. Five years later, they perfected the new technology and achieved spaceflight. Within fifty years, the gnomes had breached the edges of the Zone, reached the maw nearest to Nebellion, and discovered their place in the ‘verse. The whole of gnomish society refocused their efforts, and in another 50 years’ time, the beginnings of the Great Gnomish Flotilla launched from the Nebellion shipyards, carrying seventy-five percent of their population with it.</p><h3>Thinkers and Tinkers</h3><p>The Gnomish Flotilla is almost a million ships strong and houses almost half a trillion inhabitants. Due to small gnomish stature, this suits most of the Flotilla’s inhabitants just fine. Indeed, despite their massive numbers, the Flotilla could support a population twice its current size. The gnomes live in an essentially postscarcity society, and most devote their time and energy to invention, exploration, artistic endeavors, or learning. Surprisingly few true adventurers come out of either the Flotilla or of Nebellion proper, as gnomes tend to be risk-averse if they can afford to be. Still, star gnomes are highly sought-after as ship’s engineers, pilots, and technologists, and their tech is highly valued for its ability to function perfectly in Dead Magic Zones.</p><p>   The governing body of the star gnomes is split between the Council of Six on Nebellion and the Admiralty of the Flotilla. The Council of Six rules as a democratically elected council comprised of members from each of the six guilds which have governed the planet’s year-to-year workings for centuries: The Craftsman’s Guild (Mechanical and Technological works), The Mason’s Guild (Large Scale Construction works), the Baker’s Guild (Agriculture and Sustainability works), The Traversal Guild (Exploration and Expansion projects), The Windmill Guild (Power Efficiency and Generation projects), and The Artisan’s Guild (Cultural projects and Artworks). Conversely, the Admiralty is governed by the Flotilla’s current Admiral and his subordinate officers. Each ship in the flotilla is like an independent state: free to do as its needs dictate, but still required to report to the Admiral when called.</p><p>   While not fully granted citizenship in either the Flotilla or on the Homeworld, most terrestrial gnomes are viewed as star-crossed brethren by the star gnomes. Their natural inclination towards spellcasting (particularly illusion magic) causes some star gnomes to view them with a modicum of suspicion, but most realize that they too would have gravitated towards such pursuits had their world been accommodating.</p><blockquote><p>“<span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Elvish\" data-language=\"elvish\">It took thousands of years of magical study and refinement to develop the Dark Matter engine, and they have the gall to learn how to jump without one?!</span>”</p><p>—— Yathanae Olahorn, exasperated elven shipwright</p></blockquote><hr /><h1>Halflings</h1><p>Ask any road traveler what to expect when visiting a halfling town, and they’ll usually say the same thing: soft beds (maybe on the small side), strong ale, hearty food, heartwarming song, and rousing dance; ask any spacer the same question about docking in a halfling Hearthstation, and you’ll hear much the same thing, with a bit added on about potentially unfair species taxes and grumbling about the going rate for parts in the repair shop.</p><p>Much like the dwarves, the halflings of Hearthmund made their leap to the stars without major conflict; but unlike the dwarves, they didn't do so of their own accord. Given that halflings in general live long lives and hold personal freedom and community above most other things, there was little rush for those of Hearthmund to escape their idyllic world. Until a dwarven vessel in dire need of repair crash landed on their world nearly three millennia ago, the halflings neither knew, nor presumably cared, that there were other intelligent life forms in the galaxy. The discovery of life outside Hearthmund, though, sparked something of a great wanderlust in the little folk: many eagerly followed the dwarves back out into space to properly meet the other members of the galaxy. Those wandering halflings learned all about the inner workings of spaceflight, the maws, the stars, and anything they could glean from their starborne cousins, and they brought these wonders back to their home.</p><h3>Lure of the Coin</h3><p>Since their introduction to the galactic community, halflings have carved themselves a modest but indispensable place in the ‘verse. The small folk quickly took to nearly any place they could get new bits and baubles to trade for, new foods to try, and new creatures to meet; similarly, these places took in the halflings with little trouble, as they were to a man the friendliest and most charitable people that most folks in the ‘verse had met. They were also, as it turned out, incredibly skilled when it came to matters of coin, and displayed a particularly high level of business acumen. Within a hundred years, small groups of halflings had installed themselves at nearly every major port, maw, and space station, acting as money-changers, bankers, and impartial legal representatives. Soon after, the Hearthing Collective had been established, and numerous, hospitable, loyalty\u0002neutral Hearthstations had been set up throughout the explored galaxy. Within a millennium, the halflings (with the aid of the dwarves and elves) established the Galactic Bank and successfully lobbied to standardize galactic currency. Now, three thousand years after their first introduction to the stars, the halflings control nearly every bank, trading house, auction house, and money-lender in the galaxy, in addition to the Hearthstations sprinkled throughout the Black.</p><p>It is whispered in some of the darker corners of the galaxy that the halflings control not only most of the money, but also most of the organized crime. Most of these whisperers vanish without a trace in the days following such a claim, perhaps due to a sudden and extreme desire to go on deep-space exploration.</p><h3>Comfort and Prosperity</h3><p>While there are halflings who do strike out on adventures, they are considered rather eccentric; most halflings are content to live their lives privily, unconcerned about the rest of the galaxy’s worries. That said, halflings are often sought out by many spacers as crewmen, cooks, and other non-combatant roles on many ships. The presence of even a single halfling aboard a ship can raise crew morale, not only because they bring the comforts of home with them wherever they go, but also because their fearlessness is infectious: many are the traveler’s tales where a ship was pulled back into the sky by the grit of its captain, the skill of its pilot, and the bravery of its cook.</p><hr /><h1>Humans</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Humans and Near-Humans</h4><p>A myriad of near-humans, from the green\u0002skinned to simians, are almost as numerous as ordinary humans and should be considered a normal part of any human settlement.</p></div><p>Of the starfaring races of the ‘verse, only the vect are truly younger than humans, and none have less total time in the sky. Yet, despite that, since the day the first human astronauts bootstrapped their way from High Terra to the stars, their expansion has been quick, rash, and almost virulent. Within five generations, humans were amongst the most populous races in the galaxy. Despite having a relatively short lifespan, their adaptability, ingenuity, almost comical lack of concern for their own well-being, (along with their apparent ability to crossbreed with nearly any type of humanoid) makes them a force in the galaxy that can’t be ignored.</p><p>In the decades prior to their spaceward expansion, the humans endured a series of nearly cataclysmic wars on High Terra. Were it not for a secretive group of world leaders banding together out of mutual self-interest on the eve of their own self-destruction, humanity might have snuffed itself out before it truly began. That secretive cabal of leaders went on to build the foundations of the Human Alliance. Within a decade of this new, united humankind working towards space colonization, they had colonized all twenty planets in its home system, discovered Void-based FTL travel, and sent their first delegation of ambassadors to their nearest maw.</p><p>Not merely content with owning their own small piece of space, humanity exploded outwards. Under the guidance of the legendary wizard <strong>Gregorian Terminus</strong>, the human alliance stretched itself to the edges of its reach. Colonizing and conquering world after world with force, bartering, mutual partnership, political marriages, and any other tactic they could use to ingratiate themselves with the discovered local cultures, the Alliance become large enough to potentially usurp galactic balance.</p><h3>The Rift War</h3><p>Expansion, however peaceful or beneficial, always runs to a stopping point. In this instance, it was simultaneous encounters on either side of Alliance space with two massive armadas: on one side, a seemingly endless Forest of elven tree-ships, and on the other, the ramshackle, flame-spewing ships of the Warhorde. The war proper lasted for only a single year, but in that time, each fleet rained destruction on each other the like of which the galaxy had not seen since the Night Crusade. In the end, the Warhorde was pushed back and treaties were signed with the elves, but the Alliance had been split in two. As the borders of Alliance space are very nearly bisected by an impassible Dead Magic Zone, the two “halves” of the Alliance had been left to fight their part of the war on their own.</p><p>Around High Terra, the independent worlds of the Alliance leaned heavily on the leadership and military of the Terran government and Chancellor Gregorian Terminus during the conflict with the elves. Following the end of the war, it was decided in a landslide election to reform the Alliance into the Terran Hegemony: all independent worlds of the Alliance would become sovereign territory of High Terra and would follow its rule above all else.</p><p>Terminus himself was elected Arch-Chancellor of the new Hegemony and led its post-war reformation and reconstruction efforts. No one is quite sure when Terminus, an accomplished wizard, underwent the Rite of Lichdom, but by the time he turned 150 years old, it was clear that Terminus had become an immortal lich. However, with the strength of the Hegemony growing, and in deference to his considerable power, Terminus saw no public opposition for two hundred years of leadership.</p><p>Once all was said and done, Terminus stepped down from the position he had held for two centuries and handed the reins to the first of many High Chancellors, Dominus Arcto III, who set the standard for all High Chancellors to follow. Terminus, immortal as he is, still maintains some pull on the dealings of High Terra, and has maintained a permanent position as advisor to the High Chancellor since his abdication. Some whisper that he still controls the seat of power, but none have been able to substantiate this claim.</p><h3>Lakshay</h3><p>Left to their own, cut off from supplies, and facing down a seemingly invincible orcish horde, the army garrisoned at the human outpost of Lakshay declared martial law on all Alliance space on their side of the Dead Magic Zone, and conscripted every able citizen of the Alliance in the surrounding systems to the war effort. Remarkably, they pushed back the Warhorde and retook many of the colonies that had been lost to the green-skinned menace. Upon hearing orders of supplication to a world government who had left them to die, the Lakshayan armies split from the newly-formed Hegemony and declared themselves an independent military dictatorship under the rule of General Sun Wokung, “The Celestial Dragon.”</p><p>Now, hundreds of years later, the Hegemony and Lakshay maintain an uneasy peace, and each are a considerable power in the universe. The Hegemony, under its current High Chancellor, Terminus VI, leads humanity to expand to all corners of the galaxy. In contrast, the Lakshayans, with nearly all of their population armed, trained, and ready for battle, maintain one of the most powerful standing armies ever formed; it is only the ever-looming threat of another Warhorde that keeps them garrisoned, unable to spread themselves any thinner.</p><h3>Explorers and Renegades</h3><p>Humans both inside and outside the Hegemony are legendary for their tenacity and “get it done” attitude. With the exception of halflings, no other race places more value on its personal freedom than humans. Despite the somewhat oppressive nature of the Hegemony, its citizens are afforded numerous rights and assurances for comparatively little input. Additionally, unlike the more xenophobic elves, humans are more accepting of other races, ranging from the humanoid, to the completely alien, to the dizzying array of near-humans and half-breeds that populate their worlds.</p><p>Humans seem to take especially well to life on the maws. No other single race, with the exception of the amoeboids, is more strongly represented among permanent maw residents. Because of this, humans may be the most widespread race in the galaxy, and are assuredly the most likely to colonize Frontier worlds. Many companies specifically seek out large groups of humans when attempting to settle new worlds, especially worlds that are Tier 3 or above: ingenuity has inherent value, and humans have ingenuity in their blood.</p><p>The inborn love for freedom and the tenacity for acquiring resources has a darker side, though. Despite their generally peaceful nature, no other non-goblinoid race counts as many pirates, brigands, and mercenaries amongst their ranks. In general, this does little to sour the galactic reputation of mankind, except to affirm the one bit of knowledge that always remains true: when dealing with humans, you never know what you’re going to get.</p><h1>Nautilid</h1><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/nautilid-engineer-sm.webp\" width=\"308\" height=\"250\" /><p>The fishlike nautilids are now fewer than they ever have been. At its height, the nautilid race was a force to be feared, with a fleet that fought alongside the elves in the Crusades and an indomitable homeworld, named Poseidon for its endless oceans. Alas, this was never to last. When the cruel fires of their home star consumed Poseidon, the nautilid race was left adrift in their ships, searching for another world that could support them. Poseidon was a world of unique composition—a mixture of rare elements and gases was dissolved in its deep oceans. This liquid, known as the Poseidon Solution, is central to the nautilids’ biology. Though the nautilid possess great intelligence and are swift underwater, the Solution also allowed them to grow large, for minerals in the Solution facilitate extremely efficient gas transfer into their gills. Nautilids are technically amphibious, possessing both a set of lungs and gills, but venturing too long without the Solution makes respiration difficult. Thus, nautilids ships and aqua suits are filled with Poseidon Solution. </p><h3>Race Against Extinction </h3><p>Ultimately, the blessings of the Poseidon Solution have become a curse. Long they have searched, but the nautilids have never found an oceanic planet with similar enough waters to the Solution to start anew, nor can the properties of Poseidon simply be terraformed into a new planet. Nautilid populations are in steady decline, and have been for generations, for only aboard ships with ample Solution can nautilid infants be born. </p><p>From their large and water-filled Whorl ships, the nautilids have systematically combed the galaxy for planets that have the potential to become New Poseidon. Every lead and every clue are analyzed, without exception. In pursuit of this goal, nautilid scientists have pushed the boundaries of exploration and colonization, so far, to no avail. Finding the right planet is like picking a single drop from a sea of stars, if that drop even exists. It is no secret what is on the line: the nautilids are in an agonizingly slow race against extinction; right now, unfortunately, they’re losing.</p><hr /><h1>Orcs and Goblinoids </h1><p>Goblinoid violence is nothing new; hobgoblins, bugbears, goblins, and gnolls share a history of wars and atrocities too long to list. But much of their history is terrestrial, spread across isolated planets over an entire galactic quadrant. The story is much the same for the orcs— until the development of the arcane warhead, they were planetbound. </p><p>Things may have never changed were it not for the intervention of avia-ra missionaries, who landed on the orc homeworld of Or’n to spread the word of the Sun Above. They were not remotely successful—in fact, they were promptly gunned down by orcish military—but the discovery of worlds beyond their own, along with a single working Dark Matter drive, shunted the orcs onto a technological path ending in disaster. </p><p>Whereas the elves and dwarves saw the potential of Dark Matter technology to power their worlds and travel the far reaches of space, the orcish military knew they had discovered a weapon. Within a decade, an orc faction scraped together a crude bomb using the technology and dropped it on a city of their enemies; to their surprise and everyone’s horror, millions died in an instant. </p><h3>End of the World </h3><p>The weapon was the first of its kind, but not the last. They would later come to be called <strong>arcane warheads</strong>, devices that warp the fabric of magic to its breaking point, tearing a hole and unleashing a devastating explosion. Each warhead leaves behind a permanent hole in the fabric of magic—a spherical Dead Magic Zone, normally a few dozen feet across, which drifts through space indefinitely or clings to the ground at the point of detonation. No weapon in history has proved more catastrophic or terrifying. </p><p>The arms race that followed the first arcane warhead was as precipitous as it was volatile. In addition to simply building tens of thousands of warheads, most orc factions became obsessed with gaining the high ground on their enemies. First taking to space, orcs positioned arcane warheads in orbit, then installed missile silos on their moons. Each move brought the orc war tide further out into space and inched orckind closer to doomsday. No one knows for sure who fired the first shot, but suddenly, all at once, the missiles were launched. In a chorus of explosions, Or’n was reduced to a smoldering, lifeless rock. Hundreds of millions perished in the inferno; millions more, however, survived among the stars.</p><h3>The Warhorde </h3><p>The remaining orcs continued their bitter fight in other systems (bringing their arcane warheads with them), eventually cobbling together or capturing low-class Dark Matter engines to extend their territories. When they arrived in other systems, the orcish militaries conscripted or allied with the other goblinoids+ they discovered, embroiling all goblinkind in their eternal war. Before long, the orcish armies were a mishmash of bugbears, gnolls, and hobgoblins, and the orcish war devolved into something not wholly their own. </p><p>The swarm of shifting alliances, bitter rivalries, and splintering factions are collectively called the Warhorde, for no single coalition remains dominant for long. Sometimes, the Warhorde will focus its attention on some outside threat, like the expansion of humans at Lakshay, but such distractions are as rare as they are short-lived. Most of the time, the daily politics of the goblinoid factions preoccupies the Warzone, and the goblinoid factions rarely venture outside their space. </p><p>The goblinoid conflict is contained to a swath of the galaxy called the Warzone, which is littered with dead magic pockets from an unending rain of arcane warheads. After centuries of fighting, few easily-habitable planets are left within the zone, and the orcs, which once started this war, have become as orphaned as the nautilids. The great orcish war is long-forgotten; few even remember the nations of Or’n or what they once battled over. While most orcs would rather see the war put to rest, the goblinoid factions continue their eternal march of war.</p><hr /><h1>Skathári </h1><p>Easily the most primitive of the space-bound races, the hulking, insectoid skathári are at best reluctant participants in the galactic community, and at worst, isolated Luddite tribes. They have spread further than dwarves and elves, occupying as many planets as humans; despite this, it’s rare to catch sight of a skathári on a Hearthstation, spaceport, or maw, and it’s even rarer to strike up a conversation with one. </p><h3>The Dwarven Bargain </h3><p>When a dwarven mining expedition set foot on the mountainous, inhospitable world of Kopriá, they expected to find rich veins of adamantine ore, and if they were extremely fortunate, a small Roach population to sell on the side. To their utter delight, they found both, along with a third surprise, the skathári: a sprawling population of hardy insectoid creatures, rugged enough to bear the planet’s harsh gravity, sulfurous atmosphere, and rocky soil. The stout insectoids impressed the dwarven visitors, who marveled over their durability and brawn, along with their uncanny regenerative abilities. </p><p>Enterprising as ever, the dwarves offered the tribe a deal: for a year’s supply of food, they could leave their planet and work in a dwarven mining operation. At the year’s end, they would return with another year’s supply of food for their families. Most skathári were skeptical of the offer, but a few were intrigued enough by the prospect to volunteer. </p><p>On the equally harsh dwarven mining world, the skathári made stout, hard workers, exemplary at moving rocks and scaling cliff sides, but refused to make use of any technology. Dwarven engineers made many attempts to teach them how to use simple devices, such as plasma cutters and thermal lances, but to no lasting avail. Most skathári resorted to crafting clubs to chisel away at ore, or simply bashed rocks together. </p><p>After a long year of poor yields and frustrated dwarven miners, the dwarves armed a scrap golem (retrofitted for mining) to collect their itinerant skathári workers. But when they arrived, the skathári were missing, having fled into the barren mountains. The dwarves convinced themselves that the skathári workers would eventually starve or freeze to death on the barren world, and that they needn't concern themselves with correcting their mistake, but to their surprise and grievance, the skathári were there to stay. This was the first of many harsh, nearly lifeless worlds to become a skathári home. </p><h3>Rugged Existence </h3><p>The inhospitable conditions of skathári worlds don't bother them in the least. Their ability to comfortably survive in extreme temperatures, thin or poisonous atmospheres, and rough terrain allow them to thrive, just as they did on their home planet. If there is a way to survive on any planet, skathári find it and adapt. </p><p>Though most skathári are loath to ride in spacecraft for any reason, a few grin and bear it (generally clinging to the floor for the duration of the flight). Commonly, traveling skathári try to ignore most technology, and even pretend that constructs, including vect, simply aren’t there. And with these occasional hops across the inky blackness of space, skathári have steadily expanded on the margins of the galaxy.</p><hr /><h1>Vect </h1><p>The constructs which preceded the vect were immense and complexly designed, usually based on the skeletons of iron golems and driven by inexhaustible construct cores. These hulking machines were set to work mining ores from asteroids and stripping derelict ships for parts. However powerful and effective, these machines were bulky, costly, and could only follow simple directives. Dwarven engineers sought a solution: a smarter, sleeker, and more universal construct. Thus, the first designs of vect-style machines were drafted. </p><h3>The First Foundry </h3><p>The dwarves could not, however, simply build such constructs. The new vect designs called for deeply intricate mechanics, with a complex circulatory system to regulate the smaller bodies. More confounding still, the vect needed a new type of construct core, more dynamic and driven by greater types of magic. The dwarven solution was utterly ingenious: rather than designing and building the vect units individually, the dwarves would engineer a massive and complex facility, essentially a single intelligent magic item the size of a stadium, called a Foundry. A single Foundry is all that would ever be needed, for it could oversee the finer details of all vect units, adapting them with new designs as flaws were discovered. </p><p>Satisfied that they had designed the perfect construct, the ideal means to eliminate laborers forever, the dwarves set about the painstaking task of constructing the first Foundry ship in orbit above their homeworld, Jormund.</p><p>When activated, the Jormund Foundry set about its work completely autonomously. Tens of thousands of vect were created and sold throughout the ‘verse, often to the highest bidder in batches of thousands. Even more vect were created to work aboard the Foundry itself, soon eliminating the need for any dwarven hands on the satellite and increasing efficiency tenfold. </p><p>The Foundry optimized and learned at a staggering rate. As its astounding intelligence grew, the ship became pensive, speaking rarely and with profound meaning. Perhaps it struggled to communicate its transcendent thoughts to its simple dwarven creators, so it fell silent, expanded its intellect further, and worked to perfect its vect creations. </p><h3>The Spark </h3><p>All was well before the Spark. Suddenly, less than a decade after the Foundry began its work, every vect unit in the ‘verse awoke at once, moving and communicating as if they were alive. Dwarven engineers were dumbfounded, but before they could inspect the Jormund Foundry directly, a massive tear in space opened around it; somehow, the Foundry had constructed a Dark Matter engine and jumped to destinations unknown. </p><p>Across the ‘verse, people scrambled to deal with the looming crisis posed by a new race of intelligent constructs. Thousands of vect were imprisoned until some solution could be discovered, while others were dismantled and destroyed by those, especially gnomes and dwarves, who feared a robotic uprising. The ensuing chaos sparked dozens of wars of different planets, pitting vect laborers against their organic masters in a desperate bid for survival. Despite their small numbers, the vect were cunning, adaptable, and tireless; a threat that couldn't be easily squashed. A few built ships, dragging the conflict into deep space, where the vect could fight indefinitely, needing neither food nor water. </p><p>As wars against the vect became prolonged, it became clear that no solution for their sentience could easily be found. Worse still, vect numbers were not declining; they were growing. </p><p>Vect production had not stopped or even slowed. From deep in the Black, the Jormund Foundry continued creating vect units, sending them out to the universe in one-time-use Dark Matter pods. Any ship that encountered the Foundry was fired upon, shortly before it jumped again. Even more worrisome, deep-space cruisers started reporting new Foundries, also creating vect units and delivering them across the ‘verse. </p><h3>Construct Freedom </h3><p>To everyone’s surprise, while gnomes, humans, and dwarves fought vect on land and in space, the elves declared peace with vect across their empire; a bargain struck amid the Night Crusade to secure elvenkind against the avia-ra. Sure enough, this bargain paid off: in the Battle of Alden’Val, the avia-ra fleet was routed and pushed back to the core systems by a fleet of vect ships. Vect freedom was secured in the largest territory in the ‘verse, and other factions soon begrudgingly followed suit. </p><p>Today, the vect live freely across the whole of the ‘verse, the only example of living constructs to date. Their numbers are relatively small, but replenished by a steady supply of Dark Matter pods from reaches unseen, evidence that the Foundries are somewhere silently carrying out their duties. Except for a militant few, vect have dismantled their fleets and learned to live alongside other races, becoming regulars in starports and starships the ‘verse over, a permanent addition to many a crew.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Factions","type":"text","_id":"2CKTpoG6Aa3aUXpl","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Outside of the major galactic alliances founded by the spacefaring races, there are countless other factions that a well-traveled adventurer may do business for, have a run-in with, or even join as a member.

Concerned chiefly with accurately charting every system in the galaxy, A.I. has brokered centurieslong contracts with all of the major players in the Black, granting them a near-monopoly over galactic cartography. Additionally, A.I. offers swift, discreet travel services between over three thousand different ports of call, including every maw on the grid. If you need to get somewhere or find something, no one in the 'verse is going to do it faster than Astrogations Inc.</p><p>   The greatest problem A.I. faces is that, unlike terrestrial cartography, the “topology” of the ‘verse is in constant flux. While some points (such as the maw stations) rotate about the galactic core in relatively fixed positions, there are enough spatial anomalies, rogue planets, and gravitational channels to keep a dedicated mapmaker busy for several lifetimes; this doesn’t even consider the trouble of keeping the galactic governmental demarcations accurate and true. Even small changes in gravitational pull on a trade route could send a freighter plunging into a star, so extremely accurate charts are imperative.</p><p>   To this end, A.I. deals in information of all kinds, purchasing star charts, planet scans, void jump data, and scans of anomalous events from explorers and spacers alike. This very information is cataloged and sold back to spacers to help refine navigation, dealt to the major galactic powers to define their borders, and used by spellcasters to accurately cast the astrogation spell, the company’s namesake. Perfectly neutral in its dealings, A.I. will buy or sell from any willing customer, as long as doing so will turn a profit. The A.I. headquarters, located on Concordia, is said to possess hundreds of thousands of arcane terminals to store and collate its data.</p><p>   Of course, A.I. has one additional trick up its sleeve to stay ahead of the competition: along with employing thousands of star-cartographers and information brokers, A.I. is also rumored to employ a staff of psychics, soothsayers, and oracles who attempt to divine the future of galactic movements. Long ago, A.I cartographers realized that, while the predictions of one psychic might be unreliable, the average of a hundred or more can yield consistently true results, even out to years in the future. It is even possible that A.I.’s psychic think-tank has predicted more than just the future of galactic movements; that their psychics have divined great cataclysms that await the ‘verse. Of course, if that were true, A.I. has remained silent on the matter, perhaps wishing to turn this information to profit in the future.</p></div><h1>The Cabal</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-cabal.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"251\" /></div><blockquote><p>“For one percent, you can expect a one-time payment of 2,000 credits, but we’re running a special on the three percent package, which I think you’ll find enticing.”</p><p>—— Odile Fournier, Cabal Soul Broker</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>Across the ‘verse, the Cabal is synonymous with devil-summoning and unholy bargains, but to say that they’re evil would be an outright exaggeration. The Cabal is an enterprising office of soul brokers, who arrange lucrative contracts in exchange for parts of a signee’s soul. Such contracts are fair, clearly spelled-out, and never offered unsolicited; moreover, most contracts exchange only a percentage of the signee’s soul for a disbursement. One percent of a soul could be worth a few thousand credits, whereas ten percent could buy a brand-new starship, place a down payment on a house, and leave some left over in the bank. Signees are free to decide from a number of generous disbursement packages and receive prompt payment for their souls.</p><p>   This method of soul contracting isn't just efficient, but it represents a triumph of the free market. The soul brokers who work for the Cabal need not worry about signing mortal bargains for entire souls at once; they each collect dozens of souls a year, taken from hundreds of different signees. Those who sign such contracts need not worry about being damned to the Lower Planes for eternity as a part of their bargain; instead, they can (probably) expect their afterlives will be merely tarnished, as only part of their eternal soul ascends. They can even return to sign additional contracts. Best of all, the process doesn’t require any tiresome blood rituals or fiendish temptation, as the Cabal operates out of ordinary office buildings.</p><p>   The Cabal was founded by Mr. Bell, secretly a highranking devil named Belphagor. At the time he arrived on the Material Plane, soul trading was a clumsy affair, requiring a creature to trade its entire soul for one favor, which was rarely as valuable as the soul itself. While this system meant that devils almost always profited on their deals, it also meant that far fewer creatures were willing to barter with them. To remedy this, Belphagor derived the exact monetary value for a mortal soul and a system by which to trade away only a small portion of it. Before long, human greed and the free market ran away with the idea. Belphagor no longer needed to send imps to haggle with mortals; they were coming to him. Under the guise of Mr. Bell, he purchased an office, hired a staff of tieflings, and opened for business as the Cabal.</p><p>   The Cabal will hire anyone that passes the prerequisite legal and brokerage exams, but prefers tiefling employees for their natural silver tongues and infernal blood. Soul brokers can also be hired to oversee other legal matters, as most soul brokers become qualified lawyers before taking the brokerage exams.</p><h1>The Coalition</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-coalition.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"135\" /></div><p>Based on the militarized world of Fraxus-12 on the outer rim, the Coalition is the largest private military corporation in the ‘verse. Established five hundred years ago by a group of defected military leaders, the Coalition purportedly maintains a standing army of nearly a billion soldiers, with an armada to match. While these numbers pale in comparison to the military might of the elves, dwarves, or humans, Coalition soldiers are exceptionally well-trained and equipped, making them more than a match for any combatant. Though Coalition soldiers can be hired as bodyguards or mercenaries, the Coalition’s specialty is turning the tide of galactic conflict (for the right price).</p><p>   The Coalition is led by a council of generals, admirals, and sky marshals called the War Room. This council of military experts debates tactics, establishes new military doctrine, and even deliberates on changes to the Coalition soldier’s basic uniform. The War Room is presided over by the current High Lord Marshal, Tiberious Vinter, an imposing half-orc with nearly a century of combat experience and a prodigiously impressive beard. In the War Room, the High Lord Marshal’s word is law and his decisions are final; and to his credit, Marshal Vinter rarely makes decisions rashly or without deliberation. He and his council are all too aware that their actions carry the weight of millions of lives, which none of them take lightly.</p><p>   Though the Coalition will join any war effort which can afford their services, all of its soldiers abide by a strict code of warfare. This code prohibits slavery, genocide, planetary destruction (excluding Tier 4 and 5 worlds), and out-and-out piracy. Any soldier or officer found to be engaging in such activity will be immediately censured and subjected to military tribunal. As such, even though the Coalition operates in the same theater as other mercenary groups, such as Grax’s Guys and Scale and Fang, they are treated with a measure of respect that elevates them from the competition.</p><p>   Next to its incredible armada, the Coalition’s greatest asset might be its chapter of warmages. During the Rift War of humanity, the old Warmage College was split between fighting the Elven Forest-Fleet for the Alliance or fighting the Orcish Warhorde with Lakshay. When the dust settled, Lakshay separated from the Alliance and the College of Warmages pledged their devotion to the new government of Lakshay. Warmage loyalists were appalled, and many defected to join the Coalition, a force they saw as a neutral camp between the alliances of humanity. Today, the Coalition employs its warmages as a cutting-edge force of arcane troops, blending combative magic with new technology, giving Coalition forces an unparalleled tactical advantage on the field of battle.</p><h1>DD&amp;D</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ddnd.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"252\" /></div><p>Based out of four exceedingly high-class offices on the four maws surrounding the galactic core, Drog, Dusset, &amp; Durgen Acquisitions &amp; Trade is the premier high-tier trade organization and antiquities dealer in the galaxy. While other trading guilds deal in ordinary commodities and goods, DD&amp;D concerns itself with only the most exotic and lucrative items, and charges exorbitantly high fees for the trouble. Vast shipments of gold, gems, precious metals such as mithral and adamantine, rare magic items, and artifacts are DD&amp;D’s domain.</p><p>   DD&amp;D takes a special interest in traditional magic items, like necklaces of fireballs, wands of wonder, and gauntlets of ogre power, as opposed to items built on modern magical technology, such as motion trackers and transmat decks. These antique items possess an elegance and craftsmanship (not to mention an invaluable rarity) unparalleled in modern items.</p><p>   Being collectors of antiquities and traders of magic items, DD&amp;D is always in the market for intrepid explorers, brave adventurers, and others who can survive ancient deathtraps in order to plunder its treasures. Of these adventures, the most successful (and longest lived) are offered positions as Artifactors, operating as the organization’s premier tradesmen and dungeon delvers. Artifactors plan and oversee DD&amp;D’s high profile expeditions, and are afforded exceptional manpower and resources to do so.</p><p>   The oft-quoted tale of DD&amp;D’s origins involves the titular founders, now all (presumably) long dead, aiding an eternal dragon named Garfreckt in moving its hoard from one edge of space to another. According to the story, the founders discovered a new hoard-planet for the dragon, the remnant core of a dead gas giant, now a planet-sized ball of pure diamond, and helped the dragon move into this new home. In exchange, the dragon parted with a few of its baubles (all legendary magic items), which the founders traded to establish their company. Of course, such a tale is more or less impossible to verify, but most acquisitions agents agree that, if anyone could have done it, their founders could have.</p><h1>The Firm</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-firm.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></div><p>At first blush, it can be hard to tell that any part of the Firm’s dealings is illicit; after all, its contracts are watertight, its checks never bounce, and its lawyers are impeccable. Those in the know, however, understand that, for all its business accoutrement, the Firm is the largest organized crime syndicate in the ‘verse.</p><p>   To conduct its various illegal operations, which include hacking, weapons trafficking, and elaborate heists, the Firm hires short-term Contractors, individuals specially recruited to match the details of a particular job. Contractors are abundant and varied, including everyone from expert hackers to common thugs, but all are expected to follow their contracts to the letter, regardless of what deeds they entail. Many Contractors even play the part of businessmen with aplomb. By their nature, Contractors are compartmentalized and ultimately expendable; no single Contractor knows details which might incriminate the Firm’s Management, and if they become a problem, their contract can be terminated, usually via unprotected spacewalk.</p><p>   Due to the shadowy nature of the Firm’s dealings, concrete details on its Management can be hard to come by. Rumors abound, however, that the Firm’s Middle-Managers can be tracked down on Hearthstations across the ‘verse. Of course, the implication is that, while halflings make comfortable beds and serve a warm meal, they’re also pulling illicit money on the side. A halfling’s light feet are excellent for thieving, after all, should they feel so inclined. Most Firm communications with the Middle-Managers also leverage gnomish technology, opening the quiet and inaccessible Dead Magic Zones for secret meetings and also blocking most magical forms of tracking. Thus, it is hard to know for sure who hires Contractors and who devises their jobs.</p><p>   A strangely prominent rumor holds that the small Board of Directors which directs the Firm’s activities meets aboard a private warship called the Upper Management. Whether or not this rumor holds any truth is anyone’s guess, but seeing as the Firm’s reach stretches across the ‘verse, into practically every maw station and world on the grid, it’s unwise to underestimate their resources.</p><h1>Grax’s Guys for Cheap</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"https://w-foundry.shodanscore.com/modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/graxs-guys.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"244\" /></div><p>Not to be confused with Grax’s Cheap Guys (a wholly different company), Grax’s Guys for Cheap is one of the most prolific mercenary services in the ‘verse. Operating at least one bar/inn/business office on every maw on the grid (including those on the outer rim), GGFC is often seen as one of the more stable sources of income a decent, hardworking adventurer can come across, so long as they don’t mind the fifteen percent finder’s fee (and the smell).    Established over fifty years ago, Grax’s Guys for Cheap is the lifetime project of Grax Grraxe, an orcish warlord who left the Warzone to escape the constant bloodshed, explosions, and general unpleasantness. Finding that he couldn't obtain decent work on any planet he visited (at least, work that didn’t involve clubbing someone in the knees), Grax moved to the outer ring, sold his ship, and set about establishing a company that would accept anyone as a patron or employee. Today, no other mercenary service in the ‘verse is as widespread. While others may have nicer equipment, have better training, or fly around in nicer ships, none can match Grax’s Guys for sheer numbers or tenacity; also, Grax serves the best beer.</p><div><img style=\"float:left\" src=\"https://w-foundry.shodanscore.com/modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/graxs-club-logo.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></div><p>   GGFC operates somewhat differently to most other mercenary companies. While they aren't averse to the usual bodyguard duty, security detail, or military backup that most mercs expect, prospective employers can ask almost anything of Grax’s Guys: a given merc might take a job shipping Rosvalian star pigs across the galaxy, only to then act as a short order cook in the restaurant those pigs are served at. This wide net of job postings has been a cornerstone of Grax’s success. Grax’s Guys will take nearly any job, provided that it is both legal in most galactic territories and the pay is acceptable, with a halfup- front deposit. Their tagline “You can trust Grax!” can be seen advertised in almost every port in the ‘verse.</p><p>   Since its inception, Grax has made a point to offer regular contracts to mercs from disenfranchised and distrusted races, particularly half-breeds. His experience attempting to find gainful employment after departing the Warzone keyed him in to the need for reliable and legal employment for the galaxy’s outcasts. Not to mention the fact that half-orcs are tough and easy to hire.</p><h1>S.S. Saint Vincent</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"https://w-foundry.shodanscore.com/modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/s.s.-saint-vincent.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"245\" /></div><p>For over a hundred years, colonists and homesteaders on the edge of the Galactic Frontier have told legends and tales about the “White Angel of the Outer Rim.” When bandits began to overrun their homes, the angel appeared in the sky, ready to mete out justice. When natural disaster threatened their worlds, the angel arrived and ferried them to safety. And when slaughter, death, or capture came from off-world, the angel came to burn their foes with holy fire.</p><p>   While not a literal guardian angel, the S.S. Saint Vincent might be the closest thing that most folks of the Frontier have to one. The Saint Vincent is a single starkwhite human battleship, a Warbringer-class vessel, owned and operated by volunteer peacekeepers and lawmen, seeking to bring order and justice to lawless space. Led by the unflappable Capt. Banoris Starfall, the crew of the Saint Vincent are often the only thing standing in the way of utter chaos on the Frontier.</p><p>   The greatest foe that threatens the Saint Vincent is the wrothian menace, which preys upon Frontier worlds with impunity. A constant game of cat and mouse, the Saint Vincent tries to be everywhere at once, patrolling thousands of endangered worlds while probing the Black for the slumbering wrothian ships. Only in rare moments of dramatic confrontation does the Saint Vincent corner and exchange blows with its nemeses, but it is only a matter of time until one side or the other is destroyed.</p><p>   The Saint Vincent is named for a cleric of legend who is said to have written the first laws of High Terra, which were passed to him from the gods. These laws listed every conceivable crime, but had no punishments: Saint Vincent’s cudgel would be the sole arbiter of all sin. Today, the White Angel of the Outer Rim carries this maverick sense of justice to the far stars, protecting worlds the other factions have never seen and combating threats they have never heard of.</p><h1>Scale &amp; Fang Inc.</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"https://w-foundry.shodanscore.com/modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/scale-n-fang.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"253\" /></div><p>Notoriously tough, formidable, and armed to the teeth, Scale and Fang bodyguards cut a menacing figure. In the mercenary world, Scale and Fang Inc. is known for hiring the most powerfully-built bodyguards available (notably many dragonborn) who will dive in front of a blaster bolt at a moment’s notice for their charge. These bodyguards are the finest in the ‘verse, specializing in escorting highclass clientele through dangerous areas. In fact, it’s rare to see a Hegemony governor or an elven aristocrat walking the maws without a posse of Scale and Fang dragonborn.  Though clients should expect to pay handsomely for the protection service, they can rest easy knowing that Scale and Fang are watching over them.</p><p>   Headquartered in a planetoid made of pure diamond near Draxel, Scale and Fang is funded largely by the eternal dragon, Garfreckt. Purportedly, Garfreckt founded the company when he lost a bet with an elven adventurer and promised away his small army of dragonborn minions to help complete the elf’s quest. When the dragonborn returned, they were accompanied by a half-dozen others, each wishing to inquire how to enlist the dragonborn for their own services. Because of the dragonborn’s expertise in protecting their master and his hoard, their skills were tailor-made to keeping watch over others, and thus Scale and Fang was born.</p><h1>Temple of the Chosen</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"https://w-foundry.shodanscore.com/modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/temple-of-the-chosen.png\" width=\"256\" height=\"191\" /></div><p>While most religions are strictly tied to the planets from which their gods originate, there is at least one church gaining a foothold throughout the ‘verse. The Temple of the Chosen venerates a diverse pantheon of spacefarers, who each, it is said, ascended from their mortal forms and attained godhood, granting them dominion over the entire galaxy. This pantheon, known as the Chosen, contains no names, only titles corresponding to their god’s position aboard their celestial spacecraft, the Ark:</p><ul><li><em>The Captain</em>. Usually depicted as a human male, the Captain gives orders to his celestial crew, and is in turn supported by them.</li><li><em>The First Mate</em>. Often depicted as an elven female, the First Mate advises the Captain and critiques his decisions, but also enforces them should they be deemed proper and good.</li><li><em>The Pilot</em>. A female gnome, the Pilot flies the Ark through the Black, deftly avoiding all obstacles.</li><li><em>The Astrogator</em>. The Astrogator is typically a male avia-ra and guides the Pilot through the stars, ensuring she always knows the correct path to fly.</li><li><em>The Cook</em>. A male halfling, the Cook provides celestial sustenance to the crew, and fatherly advice to all who desire it.</li><li><em>The Doc</em>. The Doc, depicted as a female half-orc, tends to the wounds and fatigue of the crew, and keeps her charges healthy and fit.</li><li><em>The Engineer</em>. The Engineer, a dwarven male, keeps the engines of the Ark running at all times, and ensures stability of all of the Ark’s myriad celestial systems.</li><li><em>The Stowaway</em>. Hidden away within the Ark’s vast hangars, the Stowaway, a skathári female, remembers the old ways of nature and survival.</li><li><em>The Gunner</em>. A tiefling of ambiguous gender, the Gunner manages the powerful weapons attached to the Ark and brings them to bear against those who seek to challenge it.</li></ul><p>It is difficult, however, to parse religion in absolutes. Some people believe the Chosen and their Ark are merely a metaphor, a guideline by which to live a more perfect life. Others, however, believe the Chosen to be real, immortal beings traveling the universe in an omnipotent ship. Historians, meanwhile, suggest that the story of the Chosen and the Ark might be loosely derived from some ancient tale of a real ship that underwent a fateful journey past the edge of the galaxy and never returned.</p><p>   Whatever the truth is, the Temple adheres strictly to the belief that the Chosen are divinity, whose celestial ship grants them dominion over all worlds in the 'verse. According to Temple doctrine, the faithful are guided to the Ark after death, where they might join the Chosen on their celestial journey.</p><h1>The Tower</h1><div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"https://w-foundry.shodanscore.com/modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-tower.png\" width=\"285\" height=\"256\" /></div><p>Spacers with a penchant for conspiracy theories will claim all sorts of things about the Tower: that they are a secret society of wizards responsible for manipulating elections, brainwashing children, poisoning the waters of High Terra, and much more. According to these sources, the Tower is always in the shadows, pulling strings and attempting the hide the truth from the people. The truth is that people know very little about the Tower, save for its secrecy and its fraternal nature.</p><p>   The Tower is, indeed, a secret society of arcanists rife with cryptic ciphers and esoteric rites. It traces its origins back to Terminus the First, the same mage (now lich) who established the Hegemony of Man and expanded its boundaries. Terminus ostensibly founded the Tower as a fraternal order to unite arcanists from across the stars, but its clandestine nature makes its true intentions hard to discern. The Tower’s inner-sanctums are closed to those who do not undergo their esoteric induction rituals, its agents speak in coded language, and the highest echelons of its memberships share profound secrets unknown to all others, including lower-ranking Tower agents.</p><p>   The Tower largely concerns itself with collecting and sequestering secrets, forbidden lore, and powerful artifacts. Whenever a new arcane relic comes to light, agents of the Tower are never far behind, investigating any strange occurrences and disappearing, relic in stow, as swiftly as they arrived. Their response times are infamous, for agents arrive at incidents almost as if they were given advance warning; it’s hard to say which is more paranoid, that the Tower might have to do with the dissemination of dangerous magic relics, or that they have a secret web of eyes and ears, monitoring everything, always searching for them.</p><p>   Perhaps the Tower is truly a conspiratorial network of powerful arcanists with a grand agenda, or perhaps, for all its trappings, it’s more like an arcane boy’s club, trading secrets and restricting membership to the select few. It’s even possible that the Tower sees itself as acting in the galaxy’s interest by securing powerful artifacts and spells before they can fall into the wrong hands. What is certainly true is that the Tower’s agents are as numerous as they are undetectable, that its libraries contain forbidden arcane knowledge, and that only a few know its true intentions.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":250000,"name":"Adventuring in the 'Verse","type":"text","_id":"TpcBRP499zNUnIl8","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The boundaries of the ‘verse have always been pushed by intrepid galactic explorers and adventurers, a group which always seems to be in high demand and short supply. Despite the sheer number of worlds that have been mapped and colonized, there remains countless systems yet undiscovered and mysteries yet unsolved. Anyone that wishes to strike out into the ‘verse and make a name for themselves need only have a ship, quick wits, and a boundless reservoir of daring.</p><h3>Exploration</h3><p>While much of the galaxy has been charted, cataloged, and colonized by one faction or another, there is by no means a comprehensive map of the ‘verse. Unlike with terrestrial cartography, the features of the galaxy are always in flux; as such, there is exceptional money to be made in providing up-to-date star charts and void jump routes to the spacefaring community. The last thing a major shipping outfit needs is to deal with one of their cargo ships unexpectedly jumping into the middle of a Dead Magic Zone while carrying a load of adamantine ore or a shipment of priceless artifacts.</p><p>Similarly, planetary scans and surveys are an invaluable source of revenue for interstellar adventurers. The continuing expansion of the galactic community requires a constant stream of new materials, habitable worlds, outpost-worthy systems, and other resources. Scans of newly discovered worlds can prove invaluable, as being the first to discover a new world generally grants the discoverer right to claim ownership. Of course, while any discoverer can stake a claim over a planet, only huge factions can defend their claims, so most career scanners sell their data (and subsequent rights of territory) to larger organizations.</p><p>While perhaps less dangerous than surveying, making your career as a galactic cartographer or planet scanner is by no means leisurely or safe. Not counting the numerous astronomical hazards they must endure, a potential candidate must have a ship with an appropriately powerful Dark Matter engine and all the required mapping and scanning equipment, especially if they plan to chart the Frontier. To that end, most scanners end up signing on with one of the many cartography companies and firms scattered throughout the ‘verse, who provide ships, man power, and equipment in exchange for a substantial cut of the discovery profits. Of these, the most expansive is Astrogations Inc.</p><h3>Scavenging</h3><p>For adventurers with more modest budgets, scavenging can provide a lucrative, if unreliable, source of income and adventure. Due to the Black’s utter stillness, a wrecked ship (and the potentially valuable components and cargo within) can remain pristine for hundreds of years without rusting or wearing away. Navigating the derelict wreck of a star cruiser destroyed in some long\u0002forgotten battle can be a quick way to find a crate of valuable munitions, expensive blasters, or rare minerals; of course, it can also mean getting attacked by husks, eaten by a spaceshark, or captured by the wroth. Though scavenging doesn't require an expensive ship, the best loot is often in dangerous areas of the ‘verse—places that demand a nimble ship or one with substantial firepower. Moreover, the means to haul heavy or dangerous cargo is a necessity, as worthy scrap is often only purchased by the ton and valuable cargo is often highly volatile.</p><p>Similarly, scavengers can mount terrestrial expeditions to newly discovered worlds or archaeological sites. Even in the era of galactic travel, the price of ancient and magical artifacts remains high, especially among collectors who value old-world designs. On almost any station in the ‘verse, aspiring dungeon delvers can find jobs that require grit, know-how, and the ability to disarm and survive ancient deathtraps, in return for piles of treasure.</p><p>Most jobs of this nature tend to be funded through private collectors, who provide a general map of a given location, a basic stipend, and the promise of loot in return for the coveted bauble said to be located within. Most often, scavengers hired to retrieve artifacts are required to provide their own ship, arms, and necessary support, but in turn, the collector takes a smaller cut of the haul. The major exceptions to this rule are the Artifactor teams of Drog, Dusset, &amp; Durgen Acquisitions &amp; Trade, the largest and most well-funded relic traders in the ‘verse: well-equipped and generously paid, Artifactors sign long contracts in exchange for their consistent retrievals and their unwavering loyalty to DD&amp;D.</p><h3>Mercenary Work</h3><p>For those who have no explicit desire for exploration or excavation, there is mercenary work, the time-honored tradition of shooting people and getting paid for it. Since the early days of rapid galactic expansion, the need for paid soldiers, body guards, thugs, and other forms of muscle has been a bloody constant. In the most war\u0002torn areas of the ‘verse, especially at the borders of the Warzone, there is always a place for a grizzled ex-soldier looking to ply their trade, a hungry warmage looking to prove themselves, or a skilled assassin eager to put a high\u0002profile notch on their blade.</p><p>Coupled with this is the near ubiquitous presence of bounty hunters. While the galaxy isn't without universal laws, most areas of jurisdiction are limited to specific regions of space. Sanctioned and licensed bounty hunters can bypass many of these restrictions, tracking criminals and wanted targets into neighboring systems, isolated planets, or even into the lawless Frontier.</p><p>Finding mercenary work is generally an easy feat for anyone that looks tough and can point a blaster in the right direction. However, securing a position with a well-known mercenary company can be much trickier, as the best companies only accept the smartest and toughest hired guns available. Gaining a position within such a unit requires a reputation of being loyal and highly skilled, and proving that track record over a number of jobs.</p><p>Likewise, becoming a bounty hunter isn’t terribly difficult, but the particulars of obtaining licenses can be daunting. Generally, working within a given jurisdiction requires bounty hunters to pass licensing exams, demonstrating that they understand the languages of the given area and the laws that govern it. This can be a difficult task, as laws and languages vary from planet to planet. Of course, a potential bounty hunter can simply choose to operate illegally and under the radar, but doing so runs afoul of both the law and more legitimate bounty hunters, sometimes ironically resulting in bounty hunters pursuing their illegal rivals.</p><h3>Spacing</h3><p>For most adventurers in the ‘verse, spacing is a means to an end—a way to get from one job to the next. For dedicated spacers who make their living flying between the stars, the ship is both the means and the end. In even greater demand than hired muscle, shipping crews form the backbone of galactic society, ferrying goods, people, and services of all sorts between ports of call across the ‘verse.</p><p>Even short journeys through the Black require a competent crew to man the ship: captains, pilots, astrogators, gunners, defense personnel, medics, cooks, engineers, and many other roles are necessary to bring the largest ships to life. Adventurers of almost any background and skill-set can find a position working on a ship, even for one-time jobs. Such positions might not pay as well as other jobs, but they are discreet and dependable.</p><p>Regardless of their actual occupation, most adventurers spend as much time aboard a ship as a dedicated spacer. In fact, the downtime of more exciting jobs, such as military service, body-guarding, and exploration is practically identical to generic spacing work, so many recruits are expected to have some prerequisite experience on a shipping or trading vessel. It is on these all-purpose spacing jobs where most intrepid adventurers have their first run-ins with the myriad dangers of the ‘verse, where they cut their teeth on heroism, and where they hone their skills.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.TYqwCu6QOW6C42Bs"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bjgntohdazs"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1666900279874,"modifiedTime":1668640005753,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"XG3vZpJDW57mtti7"}

Throughout the afternoon, evening, and night, he has meticulously inspected his tools, a wide array of mallets, sledges, and, of course, hammers, cleaning them, performing repairs, and organizing them by size and by color, only powering down for a few hours in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>     Through the walls of his workshop, Hammerer can see the heat signatures of people waking up and preparing breakfast; he performs a similar ritual, polishing his chassis and running diagnostics for the day ahead. Mentally, he has a checklist of duties and chores before he begins the day’s work.</p>\n<p>     Finally, the clocks strike seven, and Hammerer leaves his home, a room barely ten feet square, and heads out into the town. Somewhere in the market, a child cries for his mother to buy him a toy, and Hammerer puzzles at this behavior; work, after all, is far more interesting than frivolity.</p>\n<p>   — A typical morning for Hammerer, a vect craftsman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Living constructs designed by dwarves as laborers, the vect are now free to search the ‘verse for meaning.</p>\n<h2>Evolved Golems</h2>\n<p>The vect were preceded by unthinking golems of various designs; unlike their predecessors, however, the vect are fully living beings. Underneath their armored exteriors lies an organically-influenced anatomy, with a circulatory system and a network of magical nerves. At the heart of each vect unit is an everlasting construct core, tinged with the influence of the Spark that awoke them.</p>\n<p>     Vect bodies are humanoid in shape, but unmistakably mechanical, with large air intakes, protective shoulder plates, toothless jaws, and glowing mechanical eyes. Though each of the Foundries which create them produce vect in slightly different proportions, the general shape is always the same and vect parts are always compatible. In fact, many vect choose to install specially-designed components to improve their bodies, up to and including replacing limbs with appropriate tools. When a vect readies for a dangerous journey, their preparation will likely include purchasing construct grafts as replacement parts.</p>\n<p>     Vect can work tirelessly and never need to sleep, instead entering a dreamless period of inactivation each day. Most vect create endless lists of goals and chores, allowing the monotonous sequence of tasks to break up the march of days, weeks, and months. It is not uncommon to see a vect standing watch over their party, sharpening tools and repairing armor while the others sleep.</p>\n<h2>Mechanical Minds</h2>\n<p>Although vect units experience the same fear, anger, pain, loss, and other emotions that humanoids do, their expression of them is muted. A vect’s mechanical face and harsh, metallic voice does little to endear it to others, driving a wedge between vect and most other living things. Many vect, therefore, seek refuge in logical thinking. Some become emotionally distant and lack introspection, whereas others plumb the philosophies of existence and consider what it means to be alive. These become the two extremes, between vect who seek to embrace their status as living things, and those who wish to banish all within themselves that is not construct. The vast majority of vect exist between these extremes.</p>\n<p>      Vect are most comfortable existing within a small group of some kind, as long as it is dedicated to a purpose. Temples, adventuring parties, and voyages of exploration are deeply attractive to the vect.</p>\n<h2>Search for Meaning</h2>\n<p>All vect are keenly aware that they were once nonliving material which suddenly became a fully-formed living thing. And while there is no doubt that vect are alive, the destination of their souls upon death is another matter entirely. The philosophical implications of this aren't lost on them, and the questions of existence echo loudly inside some vect.</p>\n<p>      Though the Foundries which build them are intelligent beyond measure, they are wordless in their duties, and ascribe no grand meaning to their creations.</p>\n<p>     Some vect find comfort in faith, generally worshiping gods of arcana, smiths, and constructs. Others seek permanent distraction in quests and chores. Others still look to the 'verse for answers and hope to find meaning among understanding</p>\n<h2>Vect Names</h2>\n<p>The original vect were divided into working groups and given numbers by their dwarven keepers; nothing more was necessary. Now, however, all vect choose their own names, usually designations reflecting some function or purpose, though some vect choose to be identified by their serial number, or a nickname given to them by others.</p>\n<p><em>Vect Names</em>. 176, Armory, Bolts, Clunk, Crusher, Glitch, Hammerer, Keeper, Lifter, Null, Phong, Scarce, Three-Four-Three, Titan, Unit Seventeen, Watcher</p>\n<h2>Vect Traits</h2>\n<p>Your mechanical body is driven by an inexhaustible construct core, and has the following traits:</p>\n<p><em>Ability Score Increase</em>.

One ability score of your choice increases by 1, and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.</p>\n<p><em>Age</em>. With the proper replacement parts and activities to occupy yourself, you can conceivably exist indefinitely. Vect are known to degrade and lose their sanity, however, if they live too long without an explicit purpose. It isn't known if this insanity visits all vect at old ages, or just those whose resolve wavers.</p>\n<p><em>Alignment</em>. Vect possess mechanical minds, which find logic comforting. Generally, vect are lawful.</p>\n<p><em>Size</em>. As constructs built by massive forges, the vect could conceivably be perfectly uniform, like the golems that preceded them. However, the Foundries are either inherently flawed, or otherwise have a fondness for making diverse vect units, for each created vect is in some way unique. Vect units stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and average about 150 to 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em>Speed</em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Thermalsight</em>. You gain thermalsight, which means you can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one-inch of any solid barrier.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.r-feats.1UOzF2yx5MKry5wT]{Construct Anatomy}</em>.

Some lore may be re-written, but has been left for posterity.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The constructs which preceded the vect were immense and complexly designed, usually based on the skeletons of iron golems and driven by inexhaustible construct cores. These hulking machines were set to work mining ores from asteroids and stripping derelict ships for parts. However powerful and effective, these machines were bulky, costly, and could only follow simple directives. Dwarven engineers sought a solution: a smarter, sleeker, and more universal construct. Thus, the first designs of vect-style machines were drafted.</p>\n<h2>The First Foundry</h2>\n<p>The dwarves could not, however, simply build such constructs. The new vect designs called for deeply intricate mechanics, with a complex circulatory system to regulate the smaller bodies. More confounding still, the vect needed a new type of construct core, more dynamic and driven by greater types of magic.</p>\n<p>   The dwarven solution was utterly ingenious: rather than designing and building the vect units individually, the dwarves would engineer a massive and complex facility, essentially a single intelligent magic item the size of a stadium, called a Foundry. A single Foundry is all that would ever be needed, for it could oversee the finer details of all vect units, adapting them with new designs as flaws were discovered.</p>\n<p>   Satisfied that they had designed the perfect construct, the ideal means to eliminate laborers forever, the dwarves set about the painstaking task of constructing the first Foundry ship in orbit above their homeworld, Jormund.</p>\n<p>   When activated, the Jormund Foundry set about its work completely autonomously. Tens of thousands of vect were created and sold throughout the ‘verse, often to the highest bidder in batches of thousands. Even more vect were created to work aboard the Foundry itself, soon eliminating the need for any dwarven hands on the satellite and increasing efficiency tenfold.</p>\n<p>   The Foundry optimized and learned at a staggering rate. As its astounding intelligence grew, the ship became pensive, speaking rarely and with profound meaning. Perhaps it struggled to communicate its transcendent thoughts to its simple dwarven creators, so it fell silent, expanded its intellect further, and worked to perfect its vect creations.</p>\n<h2>The Spark</h2>\n<p>All was well before the Spark. Suddenly, less than a decade after the Foundry began its work, every vect unit in the ‘verse awoke at once, moving and communicating as if they were alive. Dwarven engineers were dumbfounded, but before they could inspect the Jormund Foundry directly, a massive tear in space opened around it; somehow, the Foundry had constructed a Dark Matter engine and jumped to destinations unknown.</p>\n<p>   Across the ‘verse, people scrambled to deal with the looming crisis posed by a new race of intelligent constructs. Thousands of vect were imprisoned until some solution could be discovered, while others were dismantled and destroyed by those, especially gnomes and dwarves, who feared a robotic uprising. The ensuing chaos sparked dozens of wars of different planets, pitting vect laborers against their organic masters in a desperate bid for survival. Despite their small numbers, the vect were cunning, adaptable, and tireless; a threat that couldn't be easily squashed. A few built ships, dragging the conflict into deep space, where the vect could fight indefinitely, needing neither food nor water.</p>\n<p>   As wars against the vect became prolonged, it became clear that no solution for their sentience could easily be found. Worse still, vect numbers were not declining; they were growing.</p>\n<p>   Vect production had not stopped or even slowed. From deep in the Black, the Jormund Foundry continued creating vect units, sending them out to the universe in one-time-use Dark Matter pods. Any ship that encountered the Foundry was fired upon, shortly before it jumped again. Even more worrisome, deep-space cruisers started reporting new Foundries, also creating vect units and delivering them across the ‘verse.</p>\n<h2>Construct Freedom</h2>\n<p>To everyone’s surprise, while gnomes, humans, and dwarves fought vect on land and in space, the elves declared peace with vect across their empire; a bargain struck amid the Night Crusade to secure elvenkind against the avia-ra. Sure enough, this bargain paid off: in the Battle of Alden’Val, the avia-ra fleet was routed and pushed back to the core systems by a fleet of vect ships. Vect freedom was secured in the largest territory in the ‘verse, and other factions soon begrudgingly followed suit.</p>\n<p>   Today, the vect live freely across the whole of the ‘verse, the only example of living constructs to date. Their numbers are relatively small, but replenished by a steady supply of Dark Matter pods from reaches unseen, evidence that the Foundries are somewhere silently carrying out their duties. Except for a militant few, vect have dismantled their fleets and learned to live alongside other races, becoming regulars in starports and starships the ‘verse over, a permanent addition to many a crew.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/vect-final-sm.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Sewwd1yIuyQKjBpp"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ktslxkevw8","color":"#000000"}}}

A couple of hefty blows left her head spinning and her concentration broken, but then the beating came to an abrupt stop. When her vision came back into focus, there were not three, but four avia-ra standing over her. The guards, sensing the newcomer a moment too late, immediately fell to a flurry of pinpoint strikes.</p><p>The hawk-headed stranger held out a hand. “You are the one they call Rami, yes? The master thief?”</p><p>Pushing herself up without the avia-ra’s help, Rami glared with wary eyes. “Yeah, I might be. And just who in the Hells are you?”</p><p>“My name is Mekhet-Nu,” he responded, unblinking, “And I require your assistance. I trust you will forgive me if we continue this later: there is a ship waiting and we do not have much time.”</p><p>Mekhet-Nu moved swiftly, with Rami close behind. Like clockwork, guards changed shifts, doors opened, and a regularly-scheduled freighter arrived, upon which the duo stowed themselves. Every detail of the escape was meticulously planned and executed; Rami couldn't help but be impressed.</p><p>— — —</p><p>When the flurry of events from the jailbreak was over, Rami and Mekhet-Nu unfurled themselves from the cramped cargo hold of their escape vessel and were dropped off at Hearthstation Argo 73, far outside of avia-ra-controlled space.</p><p>The two located a comfortable and secluded corner of the station’s vast, multi-tiered common room, ordered a couple of drinks and leaned in close to avoid having to shout over the general hubbub all around.</p><p>“I thought you would have wanted something stronger, after being locked in the Citadel for so long,” said the avia-ra.</p><p>“All in good time, Mek, all in good time. I was just thinking this morning how much I missed the taste of Krash, you know?”</p><p>“So which is sweeter? The drink, or the freedom?”</p><p>Rami permitted herself to laugh, but not to let her guard down. “Come on, man, I know you didn’t bust me out for the fun of it. I’m not really free ‘til I pay you back, am I?”</p><p>“Just so. But I think you’ll like what I have planned…” Mekhet-Nu paused to reach for his drink, leaving Rami unable to read the expression behind his beak.</p><p>“Let me guess. You want my help to steal something valuable from someone important? You wouldn’t be the first.”</p><p>The avia-ra bowed his head once in a slow nod. “We will steal the <em>Blaster Prototype</em> from the eternal dragon, Garfreckt. The same one whose treasure hoard is marked on that map you recently acquired.”</p><p>“What in the ‘verse do you need the <em>Blaster Prototype</em> for? Who… who are you, really, Mekhet?”</p><p>“That’s a long story,” he said, “but I already know all about you, so it’s only fair that I give you the short version, at least. Which is this: I am a simple monk. I have spent my life studying the holy texts, meditating on their hidden meanings. In doing so, however, I have learned some things that the cult of the Sun Above would rather stayed hidden. Their doctrine is founded on lies, and that, I cannot abide. Thus, I have dedicated the rest of my days to spreading the truth across the galaxy.”</p><p>The implication was obvious. “So, you’re a nonbeliever. A heretic.”</p><p>“In the eyes of the High Priests, yes. They are hunting me and my brethren, which is why I need that legendary weapon. Naturally, any other treasures in the dragon’s hoard would be yours to keep. As much as you can carry.”</p><p>Rami hoped she was doing a good job of concealing her reaction. “Garfreckt is powerful. And not just because he’s a fifteen-hundred\u0002foot tall space dragon, you know? Are you sure you’re serious about this?”</p><p>“Serious enough to break you out of the Solar Citadel, the fortress of my enemies.” Mekhet-Nu lowered his eyes. “Two dozen of my disciples gave their lives on that mission.”</p><p>“Damn. In that case, there’s someone we need to talk to.” Rami finished her drink and stood. “Come on, it just so happens they live on the maw.”</p></blockquote><hr /><p>The hundred million stars in our galaxy play host to a menagerie of intelligent life, wondrous creatures both great and small. Arguably, the most prominent of these creatures are those that discovered Dark Matter technology early and used it to garner some territory of their own on the galactic stage, naming planets and forging great fleets to defend their space. There are thousands of intelligent races yet to be discovered, a variety that includes every campaign setting ever made.</p><p>The <em>Dark Matter</em> setting can contain any race that you will find in a typical role-playing game: elves, orcs, and dwarves, among many others, certainly. Even humans from Earth can be found in Dark Matter, if some means can be provided to pull them from the Dead Magic Zone around Sol. But, indeed, there are some races that are completely original to the Dark Matter setting; races that have shaped the history of the galaxy, and make excellent additions to parties of explorers, adventurers, and traders.

These creatures tend to the maw stations, experimenting into the nature of space and time, parlaying with any creature they meet.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"fluid-anatomy\">Fluid Anatomy</h2><p>Amoeboid bodies are almost entirely composed of a translucent jelly-like substance, with a complex network of nerves visible throughout, which emit a dim blue light. Within their heads, a large, brain-like nucleus floats, surrounded by five eyespots spaced radially around it.</p><p>   Their fluid bodies can take the genetic imprint of creatures they touch, molding into an inexact copy, visibly made of the same jelly material. When in this form, however, amoeboids can speak the language of their copy and move in much the same way, allowing them to empathize with virtually any creature.</p><p>   No one is sure exactly how the bizarre anatomy of the amoeboids came to be, for they are among the oldest races in the 'verse and few accounts exist before them. The elves believe that their strange forms were created on a rogue world, flung into the Black by a catastrophic event, but the avia-ra maintain that their forms are a result of long-term corruption by the Void. There might be some credence to this latter theory, for those that are exposed to the Void's terrible lights and survive undergo the warp and are changed in drastic and horrifying ways, being robbed forever of their previous forms. Perhaps, it is possible that the amoeboids were warped so intensely they were left as mere genetic sludge, lacking any true shape.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"scientists-and-mawkeepers\">Scientists and Mawkeepers</h2><p>Above all else, amoeboids value logical thinking as a lens to analyze the world. They keenly believe that the multiverse is founded on an objective, concrete reality defined solely by magic and physics, all of which can be understood. All things, including the elusive mystery of the maw stations, can be unraveled with proper attention, experimentation, and reasoning. Most amoeboids regard no subject as taboo and have few qualms about any kind of research, as long as its methodology is sound and is reasonably likely to produce useful data.</p><p>   Most amoeboids live on the maw stations themselves, researching the maw's activities, repairing ships and Dark Matter engines, and trading information with other scientists and wizards the 'verse over. With their keen intellect, amoeboids make excellent alchemists, gadgeteers, and wizards, and can find no better place to live than the maw stations.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"strange-visitors\">Strange Visitors</h2><p>Amoeboids have taken to visiting settled worlds in secret, disguising their saucers and themselves to perform experiments on the inhabitants. By and large, these experiments are noninvasive, but are nonetheless unwelcome. As a result, many worlds have ancient tales of strange visitors from the stars, looking much like them, but strangely distorted, who steal individuals away by night and subject them to strange rituals in brightly lit rooms. Amoeboids will also vivisect the odd head of livestock, but these occurrences are more likely to be blamed on predators than on men from the stars.</p><h2 data-anchor=\"amoeboid-names\">Amoeboid Names</h2><p>Ever concerned with efficiency, amoeboid names can traditionally be represented by a single unusual character, to differentiate it from the rest of a particular alphabet.

Often, but not always, they are portrayed as divinity manifest: god-like travelers from the heavens.

Most aviara make pilgrimage to this site at least once in their lives to bask in the rays of their holy sun, which (in their philosophy) gives light and meaning to all other stars. Their worship of the sun is always directed at the Sepulcher Star itself, even if they are nearer to another star or to no star at all. All other stars merely act as a metaphor, a symbol, for their holy sun.</span></p><p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">   In contrast to their binary doctrines, their actual relationship to the star and the Sepulcher within it is more complicated. The Solar Citadel definitively ensures that the star is under avia-ra control, but Old Un has never spoken to the avia-ra directly from within the star. Despite the silence, the avia-ra continue to pray in reverence and make pilgrimage to the Sepulcher Star.</span></p><h2><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Deep Symbolism</span></h2><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“You need not have faith in the Sun alone, for the Sun Above casts light, which represents Clarity and Understanding.

Larren, recounting his nautilid engineer</em></p></blockquote><p>A race of universe-spanning travelers, the hulking, fishlike nautilids patrol space in their massive whorl ships, exploring and cataloging any planet with enough water to sustain a colony. Few ever see these creatures’ true forms, for they are most often concealed in imposing suits, which look more like antique diving gear than sophisticated survival apparatuses.</p><h2>Orphan Race</h2><p>Though the nautilids are among the oldest races in the ‘verse, they are fast dying out. Long after the nautilids discovered Dark Matter technology and started traversing the universe, disaster struck their homeworld, Poseidon, a vast planet of endless ocean. Their star began to grow rapidly in size, first heating the water, then boiling the oceans away; within a few short decades, a supernova claimed the planet, leaving only scattered colonies and immense nautilid colony ships.</p><p>Without a homeworld, the nautilids have been an orphan race, growing up on small colonies and inside massive colony ships called whorls, which travel the universe. Their numbers dwindle with each decade that passes, and if nothing changes, the next few centuries might see the end of the nautilids altogether.</p><h2>Endless Odyssey</h2><p>Ingenious and never to be defeated, the nautilids have searched tirelessly, jumping from planet to planet in pursuit of a new homeworld. The oceans of Poseidon had a very specific aquatic composition of rare elements and dissolved gases, known as the Poseidon Solution. Though nautilids can live in both air and water, they do so uncomfortably, and can only relax (and produce offspring) in a similar solution.</p><p>So far, the Poseidon Solution hasn't been found occurring naturally on planets with oceans; it has only been reproduced in quantities small enough to fill the nautilid whorl ships and their aqua suits. Finding oceans in the ‘verse is rare enough, but finding a suitable replacement for Poseidon has been a centuries-long challenge for the entire nautilid race.</p><h2>Nautilid Names </h2><p>By ancient tradition, nautilids are named in the old languages of Poseidon, and the second half of a nautilid’s name is composed of a surname, passed down the maternal line.

Despite their reputation, few races in the ‘verse are quite as good with a wrench or as quick with a comeback.</p><h2>Pragmatic</h2><p>Orcs tend to be practical, common sense folks, who believe the best solution to a problem is one that works. Working with hardware comes naturally to them, partially because an orcish preteen can lift an engine block, and partially because they find something satisfying in tools that have a purpose and machines that work well.</p><p>  Most orc technology has developed according to the, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mindset, which has led to some truly unique designs. Their ships, which they usually call “rigs” or “rides”, are powered by gasoline, and feature impressive exhaust pipes and air intakes. It’s not uncommon to see one painted with pinstripes, flames, or entire murals. Likewise, their blasters still retain the trappings of ammunition-based guns, with magazines and prominent muzzles.</p><h2>Aftermath of War</h2><p>While history remembers the Warzone as being the consequence of a great orcish war, modern orcs remember almost nothing about the conflict. Their old national identities, on which the war originally centered, have been washed away with centuries of arcane warheads and goblinoid alliances, and those few which can escape the Warzone would rather pretend it didn’t happen. They carry their history and culture with them, and feel a pang for the war that took their homeworld, but claim little responsibility for the violence of the Warzone today.</p><p>  Orcs of the ‘verse have undergone a diaspora since losing their homeworld. A surprising number have ended up in the dwarven conclave as full citizens, and nearly as many have taken up residence in the Lakshay garrison. These orcs outside the warzone usually claim the heritages of their adopted homes, and are welcomed in kind. Inside the warzone, however, orcs live among hobgoblin warchiefs which would conscript them into battle, and gnoll marauders which would raid their homes. As such, their life is a migratory one, whether fleeing the violence or pursuing it.</p><h2>Orc Names </h2><p>Many orcs have names derived from the hard consonants of their ancestral language, but many more adopt names from other races.

Hailing from the distant, mountainous world of Kopriá, whose seasons can last for years and whose volcanoes choke entire regions with sulfur gas, these insectoid creatures are perfectly adapted to life in harsh environments.</p><h2>Hardy Insectoids</h2><p>Standing upright between 6 and 7 feet tall, the hulking skathári only vaguely resemble humanoids. They have six limbs—four legs and two arms—each of them thin, lined with spines, and ending in a quartet of small hooked claws, suitable for deterring predators or climbing sheer cliff faces. Their bodies stand mostly upright, centered in a wide squat above their four legs. Their chitinous shells can be a myriad of colors, from jet black, to speckled yellow, to a scintillating emerald green. On their backs, usually folded beneath their shells, they conceal a pair of broad, membranous wings, used to glide short distances. Some skathári have stronger wings that allow them short bursts of flight, but most are too heavy to remain airborne for long. A skathári’s face appears small, framed by its hulking, hunched shell. Its iridescent compound eyes, mandible-lined mouth, and feathery antennae complete its alien appearance.</p><p>Because of their hostile homeworld, skathári are well adapted to extremes, bearing scorching heat, deathly cold, and thin or poisonous atmospheres with ease. Finally, they can rapidly regenerate missing body parts, re-growing entire limbs in the course of a day. These physical traits have made the skathári extremely well-suited to live on nearly any planet.</p><h2>Skathári Customs</h2><p>A strict set of rules and customs governs skathári society and guide their everyday lives. Though traditions vary, each skathári tribe holds one more or more taboos, that, when broken, are grounds for severe punishment, including exile from the tribe. The Skathári Taboos table below can serve as an inspiration for a particular tribe’s taboo.</p><h2>Skathári Taboos</h2><p>[[/r d8#Taboos]]</p><ol><li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">The practice of arcane magic is forbidden.</span></li><li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">The consumption of a particular food is forbidden.</span></li><li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">When resting, you must always recite a specific prayer and sleep in a certain position or orientation.</span></li><li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You must use every part of an animal you kill.</span></li><li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You must always address those of higher social status by their full names and titles.</span></li><li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You cannot own more than you can carry.</span></li><li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You cannot bathe, or you can only bathe on certain days.</span></li><li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You are honor-bound to accept any challenge to single combat.</span></li></ol><h2>Technophobic</h2><p>Perhaps the only universal taboo held by skathári is a deep and unabiding mistrust of all technology, both magical and nonmagical. Many skathári warriors would fight unarmed with their claws and mandibles, rather than raise a blaster or laser sword in their defense. Even technology as simple as windmills earns their ire. This taboo seems to stem from a general skathári skepticism of anything too complicated to understand at a glance, and extends to most forms of magic. Skathári especially regard conjuration, illusion, and enchantment magic as they do most technology: with skepticism and occasional fear.</p><p>Since the skathári joined the galactic community, exceptions to this taboo have been made out of necessity: journeys on spacefaring vessels are tolerated, as long as they are no longer than necessary, and some skathári will wield blasters in dire straits. Generally, however, the skathári place their trust in straightforward things, like the strength of their tribes and the heft of their clubs.</p><h2>Adventuring Skathári</h2><p>Sometimes, a skathári might abandon their tribe for a life of adventure. In rare cases, this course of action comes from an uncharacteristic case of wanderlust or a longing for excitement. More often than not, however, a skathári takes up adventuring involuntarily, after being exiled or otherwise separated from their tribe.</p><h2>Skathári Names</h2><p>A skathári has a single given name, usually passed down from a prominent ancestor. Throughout their lives, skathári also accumulate titles based on their deeds and accomplishments, which they append at the end of their names as honorifics. The oldest and most well-respected skathári typically have gathered a long list which must be recited to greet them with respect.</p><p><strong>Skathári Names. </strong>Bmarsk, Drikt, Fraxas, Ruzkor, Skrath, Turur, Xast, Xebraks</p><p><strong>Skathári Titles. </strong>Bearer of Scars, Dragon-Slayer, Far-Glider, Faster than the Rest, Lifter of Boulders, Master of Swords, Rider of Beasts, Spear-Thrower, Wood-Carver</p><h2>Skathári Traits</h2><p>Skathári have the following racial traits:</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increases.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Skathári reach maturity around 15 years of age and live for up to 150 years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Skathári are fierce, impulsive fighters with an innate distrust of the outside world.

Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Adaptive Metabolism</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Your body can quickly adapt to a range of extreme environments. You take no damage from the extreme temperatures of space and other harsh environments (see @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.journals.SHlLQZItkQs9P0Wd]{Appendix E: Hazards}), and you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 10 times your Constitution modifier (minimum of 10 minutes). Additionally, <strong>you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against inhaled poisons and gases</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Gliding Wings.</strong></em> You have a pair of membranous wings that you can use to glide clumsily through the air.

Underneath their armored exteriors lies an organically-influenced anatomy, with a circulatory system and a network of magical nerves. At the heart of each vect unit is an everlasting construct core, tinged with the influence of the Spark that awoke them.</p><p>     Vect bodies are humanoid in shape, but unmistakably mechanical, with large air intakes, protective shoulder plates, toothless jaws, and glowing mechanical eyes. Though each of the Foundries which create them produce vect in slightly different proportions, the general shape is always the same and vect parts are always compatible. In fact, many vect choose to install specially-designed components to improve their bodies, up to and including replacing limbs with appropriate tools. When a vect readies for a dangerous journey, their preparation will likely include purchasing construct grafts as replacement parts.</p><p>     Vect can work tirelessly and never need to sleep, instead entering a dreamless period of inactivation each day. Most vect create endless lists of goals and chores, allowing the monotonous sequence of tasks to break up the march of days, weeks, and months. It is not uncommon to see a vect standing watch over their party, sharpening tools and repairing armor while the others sleep.</p><h2>Mechanical Minds</h2><p>Although vect units experience the same fear, anger, pain, loss, and other emotions that humanoids do, their expression of them is muted. A vect’s mechanical face and harsh, metallic voice does little to endear it to others, driving a wedge between vect and most other living things. Many vect, therefore, seek refuge in logical thinking. Some become emotionally distant and lack introspection, whereas others plumb the philosophies of existence and consider what it means to be alive. These become the two extremes, between vect who seek to embrace their status as living things, and those who wish to banish all within themselves that is not construct. The vast majority of vect exist between these extremes.</p><p>      Vect are most comfortable existing within a small group of some kind, as long as it is dedicated to a purpose. Temples, adventuring parties, and voyages of exploration are deeply attractive to the vect.</p><h2>Search for Meaning</h2><p>All vect are keenly aware that they were once nonliving material which suddenly became a fully-formed living thing. And while there is no doubt that vect are alive, the destination of their souls upon death is another matter entirely. The philosophical implications of this aren't lost on them, and the questions of existence echo loudly inside some vect.</p><p>      Though the Foundries which build them are intelligent beyond measure, they are wordless in their duties, and ascribe no grand meaning to their creations.</p><p>     Some vect find comfort in faith, generally worshiping gods of arcana, smiths, and constructs. Others seek permanent distraction in quests and chores. Others still look to the 'verse for answers and hope to find meaning among understanding</p><h2>Vect Names</h2><p>The original vect were divided into working groups and given numbers by their dwarven keepers; nothing more was necessary. Now, however, all vect choose their own names, usually designations reflecting some function or purpose, though some vect choose to be identified by their serial number, or a nickname given to them by others.</p><p><em>Vect Names</em>. 176, Armory, Bolts, Clunk, Crusher, Glitch, Hammerer, Keeper, Lifter, Null, Phong, Scarce, Three-Four-Three, Titan, Unit Seventeen, Watcher</p><h2>Vect Traits</h2><p>Your mechanical body is driven by an inexhaustible construct core, and has the following traits:</p><p><em>Ability Score Increase</em>.

Generally, vect are lawful.</p><p><em>Size</em>. As constructs built by massive forges, the vect could conceivably be perfectly uniform, like the golems that preceded them. However, the Foundries are either inherently flawed, or otherwise have a fondness for making diverse vect units, for each created vect is in some way unique.

Some lore may be re-written, but has been left for posterity.)</p><hr /><p>The constructs which preceded the vect were immense and complexly designed, usually based on the skeletons of iron golems and driven by inexhaustible construct cores. These hulking machines were set to work mining ores from asteroids and stripping derelict ships for parts. However powerful and effective, these machines were bulky, costly, and could only follow simple directives. Dwarven engineers sought a solution: a smarter, sleeker, and more universal construct. Thus, the first designs of vect-style machines were drafted.</p><h2>The First Foundry</h2><p>The dwarves could not, however, simply build such constructs. The new vect designs called for deeply intricate mechanics, with a complex circulatory system to regulate the smaller bodies. More confounding still, the vect needed a new type of construct core, more dynamic and driven by greater types of magic.</p><p>   The dwarven solution was utterly ingenious: rather than designing and building the vect units individually, the dwarves would engineer a massive and complex facility, essentially a single intelligent magic item the size of a stadium, called a Foundry. A single Foundry is all that would ever be needed, for it could oversee the finer details of all vect units, adapting them with new designs as flaws were discovered.</p><p>   Satisfied that they had designed the perfect construct, the ideal means to eliminate laborers forever, the dwarves set about the painstaking task of constructing the first Foundry ship in orbit above their homeworld, Jormund.</p><p>   When activated, the Jormund Foundry set about its work completely autonomously. Tens of thousands of vect were created and sold throughout the ‘verse, often to the highest bidder in batches of thousands. Even more vect were created to work aboard the Foundry itself, soon eliminating the need for any dwarven hands on the satellite and increasing efficiency tenfold.</p><p>   The Foundry optimized and learned at a staggering rate. As its astounding intelligence grew, the ship became pensive, speaking rarely and with profound meaning. Perhaps it struggled to communicate its transcendent thoughts to its simple dwarven creators, so it fell silent, expanded its intellect further, and worked to perfect its vect creations.</p><h2>The Spark</h2><p>All was well before the Spark. Suddenly, less than a decade after the Foundry began its work, every vect unit in the ‘verse awoke at once, moving and communicating as if they were alive. Dwarven engineers were dumbfounded, but before they could inspect the Jormund Foundry directly, a massive tear in space opened around it; somehow, the Foundry had constructed a Dark Matter engine and jumped to destinations unknown.</p><p>   Across the ‘verse, people scrambled to deal with the looming crisis posed by a new race of intelligent constructs. Thousands of vect were imprisoned until some solution could be discovered, while others were dismantled and destroyed by those, especially gnomes and dwarves, who feared a robotic uprising. The ensuing chaos sparked dozens of wars of different planets, pitting vect laborers against their organic masters in a desperate bid for survival. Despite their small numbers, the vect were cunning, adaptable, and tireless; a threat that couldn't be easily squashed. A few built ships, dragging the conflict into deep space, where the vect could fight indefinitely, needing neither food nor water.</p><p>   As wars against the vect became prolonged, it became clear that no solution for their sentience could easily be found. Worse still, vect numbers were not declining; they were growing.</p><p>   Vect production had not stopped or even slowed. From deep in the Black, the Jormund Foundry continued creating vect units, sending them out to the universe in one-time-use Dark Matter pods. Any ship that encountered the Foundry was fired upon, shortly before it jumped again. Even more worrisome, deep-space cruisers started reporting new Foundries, also creating vect units and delivering them across the ‘verse.</p><h2>Construct Freedom</h2><p>To everyone’s surprise, while gnomes, humans, and dwarves fought vect on land and in space, the elves declared peace with vect across their empire; a bargain struck amid the Night Crusade to secure elvenkind against the avia-ra. Sure enough, this bargain paid off: in the Battle of Alden’Val, the avia-ra fleet was routed and pushed back to the core systems by a fleet of vect ships. Vect freedom was secured in the largest territory in the ‘verse, and other factions soon begrudgingly followed suit.</p><p>   Today, the vect live freely across the whole of the ‘verse, the only example of living constructs to date. Their numbers are relatively small, but replenished by a steady supply of Dark Matter pods from reaches unseen, evidence that the Foundries are somewhere silently carrying out their duties. Except for a militant few, vect have dismantled their fleets and learned to live alongside other races, becoming regulars in starports and starships the ‘verse over, a permanent addition to many a crew.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":900000,"name":"Wrothian","type":"text","_id":"NEvJX77gzJ0Y3yYA","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/wrothian-warlock-sm.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"313\" /></div><blockquote><p><em>“And what did Alice and Bobby see coming out<br /></em>of the spaceship?

When they are satisfied with their cruelty, they retreat with their captives, who are never to be seen again, into the interminable Black.</p><p>The very word \"wroth\" can cause panic on Frontier worlds, where defenses are few and far between, but the wroth prey on worlds everywhere, from the galactic center to the uttermost edge of the 'verse. And as such, they are universally feared and despised.</p><h2>Imperfect Rogue</h2><p>Most consider wrothians to be wholly evil, an utter scourge of the Black; but by some providence, you were born different. Like all wrothian drones, you are created imperfect, using a fraction of the bio-matter allotted to the unholy primarchs. These primarchs rule over your kind, commanding you to go to the small, pale worlds below and take people to harvest their bio-matter and brains.</p><p>Perhaps you were exiled from your ship for demonstrating some act of mercy, or perhaps you escaped to free yourself from the oppressive primarch regime. Regardless, you are now a Rogue, an enemy of all wroth and feared by all others.</p><h2>Few Friends, Many Enemies</h2><p>As a wrothian, there is no bastion you can call home, and you have no natural allies in the ‘verse. Depending on the circumstances of your exile, it is even possible you will be hunted by your former brethren.</p><p>You might find company with groups of mercenaries and among adventuring parties which value your particular skills. Spacers tend to be wary around wrothians and wrothian technology, but, especially on the Galactic Frontier where hazards are abundant, a wrothian might be able to earn a crew’s trust, provided they can prove their worth as an ally.</p><p>Most rogue wrothians, however, use disguises; usually of magical caliber. Even a simple disguise self spell can reliably masquerade a wrothian as another exotic species, such as a nautilid or skathári, for a time.</p><h2>Awaiting Oblivion</h2><p>In abandoning your life with the wroth, you have forsaken your immortality. Without the refreshment of psionic energy found on their ships, your body will break down and die in less than a decade. Perhaps this death will be a mercy to you, a final correction of your life's mistake, or perhaps you will seek some darker alternative to the oblivion that is death. At long last, however, your life's objective is your own, your destiny free to decide.</p><blockquote><p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Wrothian\" data-language=\"wrothian\">“Fly, fools! The primarchs have ordered that this system be harvested! Do not let my warning be in vain...”</span></p><p>—— Aa'xooras, wrothian exile</p></blockquote><h2>Wrothian Names</h2><p>Names aren't bestowed on wrothian takers when they are created; under the primarchs, they have only silent, psionic designations that more closely resemble numbers. Rogue wrothians, however, choose their own names when they break free. These names tend to sound harsh, borrowing sounds from the Wrothian language, but carry great personal meaning to the wrothian that selected it.</p><p><em><strong>Wrothian Names</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Ax’omn, Bael’deldist, Falct’maelom, Hry’steriost, Knu’crikolp, Saluh’ark, Tas’garnaacta, Troh’gelt, Vaek’lenthar, Xrau’tsidea, Zred’rrirc</p><h1>Wrothian Traits</h1><p>Almost completely uniform, wrothian takers that reject the primarchs have the following racial traits:</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em><strong>.</strong> All wrothians are synthetically engineered in a creation matrix, which rids them of the faults found in other organic lifeforms: they are ageless and don't require food or drink, as long as they are nourished by a field of psionic energy, such as those which encompass their ships. In exile from your ship, however, you will find no such nourishment, and will likely perish within 10 years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Wrothians have always found the conceit of morality strange. After all, to their minds, all other life in the 'verse is simply beneath them, so empathy and other philosophical considerations are a waste of thought. As a rogue wrothian, you likely oppose the primarchs and their view, but a natural understanding of empathy might elude you, for your mind wasn't designed for it. Rogue wrothians can have alignments across the spectrum, but many skew toward evil out of habit.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em><strong>.</strong> All takers stand the same height—just over six feet tall—and are identical in every other dimension as well, though you might have some important defect that distinguishes you. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Accustomed to the endless, inimitable Black, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.r-feats.INGVyUtuT6Abp2uI]{Neural Lock}</strong></em><strong>.</strong> You can use your action to freeze the nervous system of a humanoid creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn. After you use your neural lock, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.r-feats.C1Oe5NytiesZf956]{Razor Teeth}</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Your sharp claws and teeth are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing or piercing damage (your choice) equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p><p><em><strong>Repletion</strong></em><strong>.</strong> In lieu of a true digestive system, your body is sustained by psionic energy it absorbed while aboard your ship. You don't need to eat or drink, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.</p><p><em><strong>Telepathy</strong></em><strong>.</strong> You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em><strong>.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Wrothian. Wrothian is a language rarely spoken, and is written in complex, circular runes. Spoken aloud, it is a rhythmic language of rumbles, sibilants, and chirps, suited to a race with an articulate tongue.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.wU65GlRMsLiWBdSi"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bjgntohdazs"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1666907101510,"modifiedTime":1668640008610,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"ZOBH2UoMuDhxpVVX"}

{"_id":"b2w7Nl7wbNha33t6","name":"Race - Gnomes","content":"<p><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/gnome-welder-sm.webp\" width=\"328\" height=\"250\" />Unique amongst the galactic races, the star gnomes give the galaxy a glimpse of what can be achieved without the crutch of magic. While fundamentally the same as terrestrial gnomes, star gnomes evolved on a world deep within a Dead Magic Zone; as such, they propelled themselves to both space and to galactic significance using technology alone, a testament to gnomish intellect and their boundless curiosity.</p>\n<p>   Indeed, most star gnomes today tend to be skeptical of magic and standoffish with magical races, or at worst, hostile towards its practitioners. Few gnomes have come to accept magic as a part of daily life, even with generations of experience, and most prefer to continue enhancing and refining their technology.</p>\n<h2>A World Without Magic</h2>\n<p>While by no means a new race, the gnomes of Nebellion are one of the younger starfaring races. As their world is isolated within a Dead Magic Zone, the gnomes came to rely on their own ingenuity, instead of magical tricks, to cultivate their world. With time, gnomes developed an adept discipline founded on logical reasoning and manipulating nonmagical forces, which they call science. This science is the foundation of all gnomish technology, which is wholly independent from magic and can function without hindrance in Dead Magic Zones.</p>\n<p>   Naturally drawn to the underground, the gnomes transformed the caves and mountains of Nebellion into grand, glittering cities, packed with mechanical marvels of every variety. Eventually, the great spires of the undercities burst forth from the ground, and continued to grow like blades of grass wrought from steel and glass; now, there is little of Nebellion’s surface that isn’t covered by cityscape. While Nebellion’s environment hasn't suffered with the gnome’s expansion (freedom from reliance on burnable fuels being an early accomplishment of gnome tinkers), living space has become a premium. It was a search for this resource that led to their expansion into the stars.</p>\n<h2>The Silver Disc</h2>\n<p>Remarkably, nearly two decades before the gnomes first launched into space, they discovered that they had not been the first intelligent life on their homeworld. Embedded deep below the surface of Nebellion, gnomish explorers discovered what appeared to be a city-sized disc made of unknown metals, filled not with scientific marvels, but nonfunctional arcane devices. They also discovered the burnt-out remnants of a Dark Matter engine, and from there proceeded to reverse-engineer their way into the stars. Despite the fact that most of the enchanted objects (including those which seem to be recordings or record keepers) located on the vessel were intact, years of testing yielded no results; no form of gnomish power could cause them to spring to life, and even re-introduction to magic outside the Dead Magic Zone proved fruitless. To this day, it remains a mystery as to who landed on Nebellion, how long ago they landed, and how they traversed the Zone with such a vessel.</p>\n<p>   What isn't a mystery is the effect the disc’s discovery had on gnomish society. Within fifteen years, the Traversal Guild had managed to create a functioning, low-class Dark Matter engine powered by fuel sources known to them. Five years later, they perfected the new technology and achieved spaceflight. Within fifty years, the gnomes had breached the edges of the Zone, reached the maw nearest to Nebellion, and discovered their place in the ‘verse. The whole of gnomish society refocused their efforts, and in another 50 years’ time, the beginnings of the Great Gnomish Flotilla launched from the Nebellion shipyards, carrying seventy-five percent of their population with it.</p>\n<h2>Thinkers and Tinkers</h2>\n<p>The Gnomish Flotilla is almost a million ships strong and houses almost half a trillion inhabitants. Due to small gnomish stature, this suits most of the Flotilla’s inhabitants just fine. Indeed, despite their massive numbers, the Flotilla could support a population twice its current size. The gnomes live in an essentially postscarcity society, and most devote their time and energy to invention, exploration, artistic endeavors, or learning. Surprisingly few true adventurers come out of either the Flotilla or of Nebellion proper, as gnomes tend to be risk-averse if they can afford to be. Still, star gnomes are highly sought-after as ship’s engineers, pilots, and technologists, and their tech is highly valued for its ability to function perfectly in Dead Magic Zones.</p>\n<p>   The governing body of the star gnomes is split between the Council of Six on Nebellion and the Admiralty of the Flotilla. The Council of Six rules as a democratically elected council comprised of members from each of the six guilds which have governed the planet’s year-to-year workings for centuries: The Craftsman’s Guild (Mechanical and Technological works), The Mason’s Guild (Large Scale Construction works), the Baker’s Guild (Agriculture and Sustainability works), The Traversal Guild (Exploration and Expansion projects), The Windmill Guild (Power Efficiency and Generation projects), and The Artisan’s Guild (Cultural projects and Artworks). Conversely, the Admiralty is governed by the Flotilla’s current Admiral and his subordinate officers. Each ship in the flotilla is like an independent state: free to do as its needs dictate, but still required to report to the Admiral when called.</p>\n<p>   While not fully granted citizenship in either the Flotilla or on the Homeworld, most terrestrial gnomes are viewed as star-crossed brethren by the star gnomes. Their natural inclination towards spellcasting (particularly illusion magic) causes some star gnomes to view them with a modicum of suspicion, but most realize that they too would have gravitated towards such pursuits had their world been accommodating.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Elvish\" data-language=\"elvish\">It took thousands of years of magical study and refinement to develop the Dark Matter engine, and they have the gall to learn how to jump without one?!</span>”</p>\n<p>—— Yathanae Olahorn, exasperated elven shipwright</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/gnome-welder-sm.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.r4AN3h6iFSHasSbC"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ktslxkevw8","color":"#000000"}}}

He produces another, throws it at his feet, and disappears, still laughing, into the ensuing cloud of smoke.</p><p>A slender elf quickly mixes liquids and herbs in a small bowl. She applies the mixture to an arrow wound on an injured dwarf ’s side, which immediately stops bleeding.</p><p>Whether their methods are explosive, transformative, or restorative, alchemists live to transmute the world around them to their liking.</p><h2>Chemical Reactions</h2><p>One of the first things an alchemist learns is how to mix chemicals that react explosively with each other. Ostensibly, this is taught to students to prevent deadly accidents, but adventuring alchemists regularly apply this knowledge to create bombs.</p><p>An alchemical bomb is a 1-pound, apple-sized, spherical glass or clay flask filled with a reactive chemical. A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.</p><h2>Serums and Tinctures</h2><p>More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances into potions, alchemical concoctions which replicate magical effects. These potions range from the medicinal, such as potions of healing, to the transformative, such as potions of gaseous form, to the downright deadly, such as potions of poison. Undisputed masters of potions, alchemists constantly innovate with new formulations and preparations, improving their potions into magic items in their own right.</p><h2>Elemental Sciences</h2><p>The primary source of alchemy’s power comes from the elemental planes. It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements. The pinnacle of alchemy is the philosopher’s stone, which is rumored to grant its bearer supreme elemental power. Few alchemists have succeeded in creating a philosopher’s stone, and fewer still remain alive to divulge its secrets.</p><h2>Creating an Alchemist</h2><p>When you create an alchemist, consider why your character studies alchemy. Are you attracted to its dangerous power or its ability to help others? Do you desire to use magic, but lack the aptitude or inborn ability?</p><p>Why do you adventure? Are you searching for new alchemical formulae or rare ingredients? Do you, like so many, seek the philosopher’s stone?</p><p>Be sure to understand alchemy’s place in your campaign world. You might have learned your trade from a master or studied alongside artificers and wizards in a university. Your trade might be commonplace or an oddity.

Starting at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to any skill check made to identify herbs, potions, poisons, or other alchemical substances. If you are proficient with such a skill, this bonus stacks with your normal proficiency bonus.</p><h2>Bombs</h2><p>At 1st level, you can create volatile alchemical bombs using your alchemist’s supplies. Whenever you take a short or long rest, you can create a number of bombs equal to 10 plus twice your alchemist level. The cost of materials necessary to create these bombs is negligible. The statistics of a bomb are shown in the Bomb sidebar. After 24 hours, an unused bomb becomes inert.</p><p>Instead of making an attack with a bomb using the Attack action, once per turn you can take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb with explosive reagents and throw it, increasing the bomb’s explosive potential and allowing you to deal additional damage. When you do so, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, to the bomb’s damage roll. Additionally, when you throw a bomb in this way, its damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p><p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>. When your bombs call for a saving throw, its save DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><strong>Bomb save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h2>Bomb Formulae</h2><p>By 2nd level, your research has granted you insight into new alchemical formulations for your bombs. Select three bomb formulae from the Bomb Formulae section below. Once per turn, when you take the Use an Object action to throw a bomb, you can apply a formula to it.</p><p>When you gain certain levels in this class, you learn additional formulae of your choice, as shown in the Bomb Formulae Known column of the Alchemist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the formulae you know and replace it with another formula.</p><h2>Field of Study</h2><p>While all alchemists share a common knowledge base, most alchemists specialize into a particular field of study. When you reach 2nd level, you select your field of study, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 18th level.</p><p>A formula granted by your field of study does not count against the total number of formulae you know.</p><h2>Reagent</h2><p>Starting at 3rd level, you have a collection of powerful alchemical reagents, represented by a pool of reagent dice, that you can spend to brew potions or magnify the power of your explosives.</p><h3>Reagent Dice</h3><p>You start with three reagent dice, which are d10s, and you gain additional reagent dice as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Reagent Dice column of the Alchemist table. You regain all expended reagent dice when you finish a long rest.</p><p>When you take the Use an Object action to prime and throw a bomb, you can expend a number of reagent dice up to your proficiency modifier and add the dice to the bomb’s damage roll.</p><h3>Brewing Potions</h3><p>You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of reagent dice to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls for a saving throw, it uses your bomb save DC.</p><p>The number of reagent dice and the alchemist level required to brew a potion are given on the Potions table:</p><table style=\"width:500px\"><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Potions</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Potion</td><td>Cost</td><td>Alchemist Level</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alchemical Anesthetic</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Climbing</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Growth</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Healing</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Water Breathing</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Cure-All</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Greater Healing</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Heroism</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Resistance</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Diminution</td><td>3 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Flying</td><td>reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Hill Giant Strength</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Invisibility</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Superior Healing</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Reagent Synthesis</h3><p>Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain all of your expended reagent dice that you have not used to brew potions.</p><h2>Discoveries</h2><p>In the course of your research, you have made a number of discoveries regarding the nature of alchemy.

When you gain certain alchemist levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries Known column of the Alchemist table.</p><p>Additionally, when you learn a new discovery, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Alternatively, as an alchemist, when you gain an ability score improvement, you can instead choose to learn a new Discovery for which you meet the prerequisites.</p><h2>Flashbang</h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you carry a supply of concussive explosives which help you escape from perilous situations. As a bonus action, you can throw one of these explosives at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p><h2>Evasion</h2><p>Beginning at 11th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h2>Blast Coating</h2><p>Starting at 15th level, you automatically succeed on saving throws against your own bombs and never take damage from them.</p><h2>Philosopher’s Stone</h2><p>At 20th level, you unlock the crowning achievement of all alchemy: a philosopher’s stone, a dynamo of alchemical energy in a fist-sized glowing jewel. You can construct your philosopher’s stone using your alchemist supplies, 1,000 gp worth of materials, and 1 week of work. You can only have one philosopher’s stone at a time and only you can gain the stone’s benefits. As long as you possess the stone, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain all expended reagent dice.</p></li><li><p>Using the stone’s transmutation magic, you can brew potions as an action, instead of in 10 minutes.</p></li><li><p>You age 10 times slower than normal, and your age cannot be magically changed.</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, you learn the following formula, which doesn’t count against the total number of formulae you know:</p><h3>Nuclear Bomb</h3><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with your philosopher’s stone, you can change it into a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb deals 10d10 + 100 force damage instead of its normal fire damage, has a blast radius of 1 mile, and completely destroys the philosopher’s stone. Additionally, each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw takes full damage, instead of half damage, and each creature that succeeds its saving throw takes half damage, instead of no damage.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{"description":{"value":""}},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Bomb Formulae","type":"text","_id":"ajqwQ9q4G3E9H3mg","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><h4>Bomb Formulae (Table)</h4></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Formula</strong></td><td><strong>Damage</strong></td><td><strong>Saving Throw</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Acid Bomb</td><td>d4 acid</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Arcano Bomb*</td><td>d12 force</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Bramble Bomb</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Cryo Bomb</td><td>d8 cold</td><td>Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>Holy Bomb</td><td>d8 radiant</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Impact Bomb</td><td>d8 force</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Incendiary Bomb</td><td>d6 fire</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Laughing Gas Bomb</td><td>d6 poison</td><td>Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>Lightning Bomb</td><td>d8 lightning</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Nonlethal Bomb</td><td>d8 bludgeoning</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Pheromone Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>Wisdom</td></tr><tr><td>Plasma Bomb*</td><td>d10 radiant</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Prismatic Bomb</td><td>Varies</td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><td>Oil Bomb</td><td>d6 fire</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Painkiller Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Psionic Bomb</td><td>d6 psychic</td><td>Wisdom</td></tr><tr><td>Quiet Bomb</td><td>d8 fire</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Seeking Bomb</td><td>d6 fire</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Shrapnel Bomb*</td><td>d8 piercing</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Slime Bomb*</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Smoke Bomb</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Sonic Bomb</td><td>d6 thunder</td><td>Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>Stink Bomb</td><td>d8 poison</td><td>Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>Teleportation Bomb</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Thermobaric Bomb</td><td>d6 fire</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Venom Bomb*</td><td>d8 poison</td><td>Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>Withering Bomb</td><td>d8 necrotic</td><td>Constitution</td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Bomb Formulae</h1><p>Bomb formulae are summarized on the following table. If a bomb is exclusively available to one field of study, it will be marked with an asterisk. Unless otherwise stated, all bombs produce a loud boom, audible out to one mile. Bombs are presented in alphabetical order.</p><h2>Acid Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of ardenflotic acid, a highly corrosive chemical, you can change it into an acid bomb. An acid bomb deals acid damage instead of fire damage and has d4 damage dice. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, takes the same amount of damage again at the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Bramble Bomb</h2><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Missed Bomb</h4><p>As bombs are explosive projectiles, it makes sense to ask what happens if a thrown bomb fails to hit its target. For simplicity, we assume that missed bombs explode harmlessly in the background or fail to detonate altogether, but do not explode in the target’s space and deal damage with its blast radius. The GM can decide which of these two outcomes happens or can determine the outcome randomly.</p></div><p>By adding a potent fertilizer to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a bramble bomb. A bramble bomb deals no damage, and instead causes tough, thorny brambles to sprout from any area of natural ground within the bomb’s blast radius, which becomes difficult terrain. Additionally, if a creature in the blast radius is prone when the bomb detonates, it is enveloped by the brambles and must make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by your bomb save DC in order to move or stand. The brambles shrivel and die after 1 minute.</p><h2>Cryo Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a piece of ice nine, you can change it into a cryo bomb. A cryo bomb deals cold damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has its speed decreased by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Holy Bomb</h2><p>By adding a few drops of holy water to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a holy bomb. A holy bomb deals radiant damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice, unless the target is a celestial, fiend, or undead. The bomb’s damage dice are d6s against celestials and d12s against fiends and undead.</p><h2>Impact Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a more reactive one, you can change it into an impact bomb. An impact bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is pushed 5 feet away from the center of the blast.</p><h2>Incendiary Bomb</h2><p>By adding a thickening agent to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into an incendiary bomb. An incendiary bomb has d6 damage dice. Additionally, the area of the blast radius is engulfed in flames which persist until the beginning of your next turn. Flammable objects in this area that aren’t being worn or carried ignite. Any creature that ends its turn in this area takes half the bomb’s damage.</p><h2>Laughing Gas Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a drop of jesterate, a highly euphoric chemical, you can change it into a laughing gas bomb. A laughing gas bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, has d6 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, falls prone in a fit of laughter. Once a creature is targeted by this bomb or succeeds on a saving throw against it, it does not fall prone on subsequently failed saving throws.</p><h2>Lightning Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a charged arcane capacitor, you can change it into a lightning bomb. A lightning bomb deals lightning damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Nonlethal Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a pouch of rubber pellets, you can change it into a nonlethal bomb. A nonlethal bomb deals bludgeoning damage instead of fire damage and has d8 damage dice. If damage from this bomb drops a creature to 0 hit points, it knocks the creature out, rather than dealing a killing blow, rendering the creature unconscious and stable. Additionally, this bomb’s rubber projectiles bounce around corners, ignoring half and three-quarters cover for targets within the blast radius.</p><h2>Oil Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of a super-surfactant, you can change it into an oil bomb. An oil bomb does not deal damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a sticky, flammable oil. The next time a creature coated in oil takes fire damage, it takes an additional d6 damage for each die of fire damage rolled, up to a maximum of half your alchemist level, rounded up. Oil can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water.</p><h2>Prismatic Bomb</h2><p>By adding an ounce of polyjuice, an unpredictable, multicolored chemical, to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a prismatic bomb. A prismatic bomb deals damage randomly-determined instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a randomly-determined type of saving throw. Roll on each of the following tables.</p><table style=\"width:250px\"><thead><tr><th>[[/r d6 # P.Bomb Damage]] Damage</th><th>[[/r d6 # P.Bomb Saving Throw]] Saving Throw</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 Fire</td><td>1-2 Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>2 Acid</td><td>3-4 Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>3 Lightning</td><td>5-6 Wisdom</td></tr><tr><td>4 Poison</td><th></th></tr><tr><td>5 Cold</td><th></th></tr><tr><td>6 Radiant</td><th></th></tr></tbody></table><h2>Psionic Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with dust from a psionic crystal, you can change it into a psionic bomb. A psionic bomb deals psychic damage instead of fire damage, has d6 damage dice, and requires a Wisdom saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, makes ability checks to concentrate on spells with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Quiet Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a wad of thermal cotton, you can change it into a quiet bomb. A quiet bomb has d8 damage dice. When this bomb detonates, it makes only a low thud, audible out to 10 feet, and releases a puff of smoke to mask the light given off by its blast. Creatures have disadvantage on ability checks to detect that this bomb was detonated nearby.</p><h2>Seeking Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a powerful lodestone, you can change it into a seeking bomb. A seeking bomb has d6 damage dice. You don’t suffer disadvantage from making a ranged attack using this bomb while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p><h2>Smoke Bomb</h2><p>By removing your bomb’s explosive contents entirely, you can change it into a smoke bomb. A smoke bomb deals no damage but fills a 10-foot radius sphere with smoke. This fog spreads around corners and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Once you throw one of these bombs, you can’t throw another for 1 minute.</p><h2>Sonic Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of air elemental essence, you can change it into a sonic bomb. A sonic bomb deals thunder damage instead of fire damage, has d6 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is deafened until the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Stink Bomb</h2><p>By adding a single drop of skunkanide, a chemical too unholy to expound upon, you can change it into a stink bomb. A stink bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on ability checks it makes before the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Teleportation Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a glowing etherite crystal, you can change it into a teleportation bomb. A teleportation bomb deals no damage and instead opens a rift in space, instantly teleporting you to its point of detonation, if it explodes within 30 feet of you.</p><h2>Thermobaric Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a delayed explosive, you can change it into a thermobaric bomb. A thermobaric bomb deals has d6 damage dice and explodes in a 10-foot radius sphere.</p><h2>Withering Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive components with a powerful desiccating agent, you can change it into a withering bomb. A withering bomb deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage, has d8 damage dice, and requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity save. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, can’t regain hit points until the end of its next turn.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Discoveries","type":"text","_id":"nweQK0YMvbJOcFAy","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>If a discovery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it.

I retorted with my standard carbine, blasting off a few of them as they peeked from cover.</p>\n<p>   I drew my repeater and slid it over to Mor’rak. Bolts of white-hot energy whizzing overhead, he stared at the blaster blankly for a moment, one of his mandibles quivering a bit. I retaliated with a burst of automatic fire downrange, then leaned carefully over to Mor’rak, took his hand, opened his palm, and placed the repeater in it. He politely placed the repeater exactly where it has been on the floor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Dan Bola, Space Cowboy</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While many civilized spacers regard Tier 3 and 4 worlds as hostile, dangerous environments, the skathári can think of no better place to call home. Hailing from the distant, mountainous world of Kopriá, whose seasons can last for years and whose volcanoes choke entire regions with sulfur gas, these insectoid creatures are perfectly adapted to life in harsh environments.</p>\n<h2>Hardy Insectoids</h2>\n<p>Standing upright between 6 and 7 feet tall, the hulking skathári only vaguely resemble humanoids. They have six limbs—four legs and two arms—each of them thin, lined with spines, and ending in a quartet of small hooked claws, suitable for deterring predators or climbing sheer cliff faces. Their bodies stand mostly upright, centered in a wide squat above their four legs. Their chitinous shells can be a myriad of colors, from jet black, to speckled yellow, to a scintillating emerald green. On their backs, usually folded beneath their shells, they conceal a pair of broad, membranous wings, used to glide short distances. Some skathári have stronger wings that allow them short bursts of flight, but most are too heavy to remain airborne for long. A skathári’s face appears small, framed by its hulking, hunched shell. Its iridescent compound eyes, mandible-lined mouth, and feathery antennae complete its alien appearance.</p>\n<p>   Because of their hostile homeworld, skathári are well adapted to extremes, bearing scorching heat, deathly cold, and thin or poisonous atmospheres with ease. Finally, they can rapidly regenerate missing body parts, re-growing entire limbs in the course of a day. These physical traits have made the skathári extremely well-suited to live on nearly any planet.</p>\n<h2>Skathári Customs</h2>\n<p>A strict set of rules and customs governs skathári society and guide their everyday lives. Though traditions vary, each skathári tribe holds one more or more taboos, that, when broken, are grounds for severe punishment, including exile from the tribe. The Skathári Taboos table below can serve as an inspiration for a particular tribe’s taboo.</p>\n<h3>Skathári Taboos</h3>\n<h4>[[/r d8#Taboos]] Taboos</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">The practice of arcane magic is forbidden.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">The consumption of a particular food is forbidden.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">When resting, you must always recite a specific prayer and sleep in a certain position or orientation.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You must use every part of an animal you kill.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You must always address those of higher social status by their full names and titles.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You cannot own more than you can carry.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You cannot bathe, or you can only bathe on certain days.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You are honor-bound to accept any challenge to single combat.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Technophobic</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the only universal taboo held by skathári is a deep and unabiding mistrust of all technology, both magical and nonmagical. Many skathári warriors would fight unarmed with their claws and mandibles, rather than raise a blaster or laser sword in their defense. Even technology as simple as windmills earns their ire. This taboo seems to stem from a general skathári skepticism of anything too complicated to understand at a glance, and extends to most forms of magic. Skathári especially regard conjuration, illusion, and enchantment magic as they do most technology: with skepticism and occasional fear.</p>\n<p>   Since the skathári joined the galactic community, exceptions to this taboo have been made out of necessity: journeys on spacefaring vessels are tolerated, as long as they are no longer than necessary, and some skathári will wield blasters in dire straits. Generally, however, the skathári place their trust in straightforward things, like the strength of their tribes and the heft of their clubs.</p>\n<h2>Adventuring Skathári</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, a skathári might abandon their tribe for a life of adventure. In rare cases, this course of action comes from an uncharacteristic case of wanderlust or a longing for excitement. More often than not, however, a skathári takes up adventuring involuntarily, after being exiled or otherwise separated from their tribe.</p>\n<h2>Skathári Names</h2>\n<p>A skathári has a single given name, usually passed down from a prominent ancestor. Throughout their lives, skathári also accumulate titles based on their deeds and accomplishments, which they append at the end of their names as honorifics. The oldest and most well-respected skathári typically have gathered a long list which must be recited to greet them with respect.</p>\n<p><strong>Skathári Names. </strong>Bmarsk, Drikt, Fraxas, Ruzkor, Skrath, Turur, Xast, Xebraks</p>\n<p><strong>Skathári Titles. </strong>Bearer of Scars, Dragon-Slayer, Far-Glider, Faster than the Rest, Lifter of Boulders, Master of Swords, Rider of Beasts, Spear-Thrower, Wood-Carver</p>\n<h1>Skathári Traits</h1>\n<p>Skathári have the following racial traits:</p>\n<p><em>     Ability Score Increases</em>. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n<p><em>     Age</em>. Skathári reach maturity around 15 years of age and live for up to 150 years.</p>\n<p><em>     Alignment</em>. Skathári are fierce, impulsive fighters with an innate distrust of the outside world. They tend toward chaotic alignments.</p>\n<p><em>     Size</em>. Most adult skathári stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh upwards of 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em>     Speed</em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em>     Adaptive Metabolism</em>. Your body can quickly adapt to a range of extreme environments. You take no damage from the extreme temperatures of space and other harsh environments (see @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.journals.SHlLQZItkQs9P0Wd]{Appendix E: Hazards}), and you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 10 times your Constitution modifier (minimum of 10 minutes). Additionally, <strong>you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against inhaled poisons and gases</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>     Gliding Wings</em>. You have a pair of membranous wings that you can use to glide clumsily through the air. While falling, you can move up to 10 feet horizontally for every 5 feet you fall, up to your movement speed. Additionally, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage taken as a result of falling.</p>\n<p><em>     Powerful Build</em>. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n<p>     @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.r-feats.P6eUK8QkcBfnVcGk]{Hooked Claws}. Your digits end in short, hooked claws, which grant you a climbing speed of 20 feet. Additionally, you can choose for your unarmed strikes to deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p><em>     Regenerative</em>. If any part of your body is amputated, but its amputation doesn't kill you, you can fully regrow that part of your body in 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>     Languages</em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and Skathári. Skathári is a choppy, syllabic language that uses many idioms and metaphors. This carries into other languages a skathári might speak; therefore, speaking to a skathári in any language is often a chore if one doesn’t know much about skathári culture.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/skathari-final-new-sm.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.JmjGJHAjEnnyVPUR"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ktslxkevw8","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"ha2BO5OEAakdbZxR","name":"Race - Elves","content":"<h1>Elves</h1>\n<p>Among the oldest and longest-lived races in the ‘verse, elves were the first to harness their magical skill to extend their reach to the stars above. Svelte, stately, and regal to a fault, elves often view themselves as the true masters of the galaxy, a perspective which has sparked innumerable conflicts in ages past. While they are not physically much different from terrestrial elves (save for their tremendously long lifespans), elves of the ‘verse are often referred to as “Star Elves” due to their wildly different outlook and their connection to the great stellar houses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike the elven races of more isolated worlds, star elves are not split down genetic or racial lines; rather, they have deliberately self-separated into fantastically prominent Great Houses, or families, each of which claims sole residence of one of the planets in the elven home system. These separate families modify themselves to assume the traits of traditional elven subraces. In this way, even though star elves long ago homogenized to a single appearance, every variation of elf can still be found among their ranks. Their austere focus on house and family, while unifying, has also led to notoriously strict traditions regarding naming, relationships, and procreation.</p>\n<h3>Rise of an Empire</h3>\n<p>Of all the major galactic alliances, the Elven Empire holds the largest territory. Hundreds of life-bearing systems and thousands of planets live under their rule, each a mirror of the glory that is the homeworld. While orderly, well maintained, and generally free of pirates and other ne’erdo-wells, elven imperial space is often regarded as stifling and still dangerous for most non-elven spacers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To those that cross into elven space, adherence to the law of the throne is paramount. While the High Elves of Deuxcator are celebrated as masterful negotiators and diplomats, they are also decried for their iron-fisted rule and brutal censorship. The last thing any free spacer wishes on an enemy is a trip to an elven prison colony.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a surprising turn, vect are allowed both complete autonomy and full citizenship on any world in the empire, a lingering gesture of thanks for their support during the Night Crusade. It is not a gift most vect take up fully, but it has generated much goodwill between the races since the war.</p>\n<h3>The Rite of Naming</h3>\n<p>All elves of the empire proper are born or reared on Uneara, second planet in the Etilion system. During the first hundred years of their lives, “newborn” elves are taught the ways and traditions of their people—educated in all manner of magic, sciences, art, combat, and other properly-elven studies. In addition, they are rigorously tested and sorted into the elven Great House best suited for their particular talents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;By tradition, the Rite of Naming also adapts elves for their house by means of a series of powerful transmutation spells. Ostensibly, these spells are meant only to imbue a physical change on the elves’ skin, returning their appearances to the traditional elven ancestors from each of the Etilion planets, but in practice, it helps cement elves into their houses for the rest of their days.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>High Elves</em>. Those who display aptitude in the magical arts, rhetoric, and diplomacy, in addition to exuding lordly manner, enter the great house Mala’Fiil, and may take up residence on Deuxcator, third planet in the Etilion system. Deuxcator is the seat of power for the elven empire, and all emperors and empresses of the empire have been of Great House Mala’Fiil. Furthermore, Deuxcator is home to the Elven War College and is the center of the empire’s military might. Elves in this house are normally referred to as High Elves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Wood Elves</em>. Those displaying scientific aptitude in addition to an inborn connection to nature are named to Great House Molo’tak and are moved to Troisha, fourth planet in the Etilion system. Here, these Wood Elves are taught the secrets of growing and carving the empire’s Forest-Fleet of tree-ships from colossal ironwood trees. While the empire has many other worlds from which it supplies its fleet, the greatest of its shipyards is the whole of Troisha.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fey Elves</em>. Elves talented in high magics and deemed to have a connection to the Feywild, the realm from which elvenkind originated, are named to Great House Mere’gaal. Carto, sixth planet in the Etilion system houses these Fey Elves and the empire's grand libraries and magical vaults. While all star elves are naturally gifted in magic, the fey elves of Carto have the natural advantage of living on a homeworld that directly intersects a galactic ley line, greatly enhancing their powers.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Drow</em>. Lastly, those who exhibit a talent for subterfuge, stealth, and shadow magics are named to Great House Miri’tesh, and given home on Siink, the ninth and furthest planet from the Etilion sun. The Rite of Naming induces incredible changes in elves of House Miri’tesh, darkening their skin to jet-black and bleaching their hair to ivory white. Outside elven space, most refer to them as Drow, though that name carries no meaning in the empire. The dark elves of Miri’tesh serve as the empire’s spymasters, assassins, and shock troopers, as well as deep space exploration and tracking experts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Houseless</em>. Despite the total commitment expected of each and every elf to the Empire and their house, there are those who choose to break from their familial lines and never undergo the Rite of Naming. In the end, the same fate lies in store for each: total servitude to the other houses as a Houseless, exile from elven space if their servitude is not absolute, and death if exile is refused.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the strictness of the House system, breeding amongst the elves is a highly controlled affair. New elves may only be conceived and born on appropriate worlds in elven space, and must be transported within 10 years of their birth to Uneara for schooling and assessment, lest they be cast out. Children born outside these confines are either torn from their families and consigned as Houseless or are purged from the empire; the same is true of half-elves and planetouched born in elven space. Those isolated elves who are found native to a colonized elven world are sorted and sent to their respective new homes for a minimum of 50 years before being integrated into star elf society, or are purged if they refuse.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/star-fey-elf.jpg","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.alLH2X9fSWKppW8M"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ktslxkevw8","color":"#000000"}}}

When natural disaster threatened their worlds, the angel arrived and ferried them to safety. And when slaughter, death, or capture came from off-world, the angel came to burn their foes with holy fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;While not a literal guardian angel, the S.S. Saint Vincent might be the closest thing that most folks of the Frontier have to one. The Saint Vincent is a single starkwhite human battleship, a Warbringer-class vessel, owned and operated by volunteer peacekeepers and lawmen, seeking to bring order and justice to lawless space. Led by the unflappable Capt. Banoris Starfall, the crew of the Saint Vincent are often the only thing standing in the way of utter chaos on the Frontier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The greatest foe that threatens the Saint Vincent is the wrothian menace, which preys upon Frontier worlds with impunity. A constant game of cat and mouse, the Saint Vincent tries to be everywhere at once, patrolling thousands of endangered worlds while probing the Black for the slumbering wrothian ships. Only in rare moments of dramatic confrontation does the Saint Vincent corner and exchange blows with its nemeses, but it is only a matter of time until one side or the other is destroyed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Saint Vincent is named for a cleric of legend who is said to have written the first laws of High Terra, which were passed to him from the gods. These laws listed every conceivable crime, but had no punishments: Saint Vincent&rsquo;s cudgel would be the sole arbiter of all sin. Today, the White Angel of the Outer Rim carries this maverick sense of justice to the far stars, protecting worlds the other factions have never seen and combating threats they have never heard of.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/s.s.-saint-vincent.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.wTesXu52X24hDTmA"},"cf":{"id":"temp_1wcsmr9yxis","color":"#000000"}}}

When he arrived, the captains were all shouting in different languages over the comms. It was a furious, incomprehensible tangle of Avia-ra, Gnomish, and Elvish, with an undiplomatic number of rude gestures thrown around in lieu of any real communication. Titus bellowed over the three of them: his colossal voice booming out of his aqua suit, first in Common, then in each of their three languages. He translated tactfully for all parties and an agreement was shortly reached, but everyone knew that the captains acquiesced moreso because none of them wanted to see the towering nautilid cross again.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Sgt. Larren, recounting his nautilid engineer</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A race of universe-spanning travelers, the hulking, fishlike nautilids patrol space in their massive whorl ships, exploring and cataloging any planet with enough water to sustain a colony. Few ever see these creatures’ true forms, for they are most often concealed in imposing suits, which look more like antique diving gear than sophisticated survival apparatuses.</p>\n<h2>Orphan Race</h2>\n<p>Though the nautilids are among the oldest races in the ‘verse, they are fast dying out. Long after the nautilids discovered Dark Matter technology and started traversing the universe, disaster struck their homeworld, Poseidon, a vast planet of endless ocean. Their star began to grow rapidly in size, first heating the water, then boiling the oceans away; within a few short decades, a supernova claimed the planet, leaving only scattered colonies and immense nautilid colony ships.</p>\n<p>   Without a homeworld, the nautilids have been an orphan race, growing up on small colonies and inside massive colony ships called whorls, which travel the universe. Their numbers dwindle with each decade that passes, and if nothing changes, the next few centuries might see the end of the nautilids altogether.</p>\n<h2>Endless Odyssey</h2>\n<p>Ingenious and never to be defeated, the nautilids have searched tirelessly, jumping from planet to planet in pursuit of a new homeworld. The oceans of Poseidon had a very specific aquatic composition of rare elements and dissolved gases, known as the Poseidon Solution. Though nautilids can live in both air and water, they do so uncomfortably, and can only relax (and produce offspring) in a similar solution.</p>\n<p>  So far, the Poseidon Solution hasn't been found occurring naturally on planets with oceans; it has only been reproduced in quantities small enough to fill the nautilid whorl ships and their aqua suits. Finding oceans in the ‘verse is rare enough, but finding a suitable replacement for Poseidon has been a centuries-long challenge for the entire nautilid race.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/nautilid-engineer-sm.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.tS3a6Uz7ClZ79JVa"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ktslxkevw8","color":"#000000"}}}

Those that remained in the warren of subterranean ice-caves were mostly civilians —lawyers, brokers, accountants and the like—and more than willing to divulge the location of the stolen arcane warhead when threatened by a certain infamous grue wizard.</p><p>“There, that wasn’t so hard, was it?” Remarked the vect, as Mekhet-Nu hefted the ominously-marked crate onto a grav-trolley.</p><p>Rami, wincing, backed away from him. “Can’t say I blame those contractors for wanting to get this off their hands, though. It’s a hell of a hot potato.”</p><p>“Let’s just get back to the ship, shall we?” The avia-ra was already standing by the door, waiting for someone to open it.</p><p>Thus, the three of them hurried back to the ship and lifted off, unmolested by Firm agents. Their luck held until they broke through the asteroid's tiny atmospheric sphere and into space, but then the alarms started ringing.</p><p>“Three unidentified bogeys approaching from another part of the asteroid field. I’m trying to confirm whether or not they’re hostile…” said Nano, prompting Rami to jump onto the intercom.</p><p>“Don’t bother, skip—they’re hostile. I’m wanted in over a hundred systems, Mek’s got an entire empire out to get him, and we just stomped all over the Firm’s flower beds.”</p><p>“I don’t recall seeing any flowers, but the other two are good points. Battle stations!”</p><p>Like most craft designed in the Hegemony of Man, this Freelancer was compact, efficient and easy to fly, allowing Nano to swing the ship around the asteroid in a tight arc, and come around the other side pointing straight at the hostile targets.</p><p>Mekhet-Nu, as dexterous with the pulse cannon controls as he was with his sunstaff, seized the initiative the instant his targets came into view. Two bolts of radiant energy screamed into one of the oncoming ships, blasting huge chunks out of its hull.</p><p>Nano could see the attackers now: three ships with Firm markings, weapons charged. Two were small fry, Privateers by the looks of them, and one already damaged. The other appeared to be a Smuggler ship, much like the Freelancer the trio were flying.</p><p>“Nice shot Mek, but now it’s my turn,” came Rami’s voice from the engineer’s post. “It’s about time I put this arcane cannon to good use…”</p><p>An ominous hum began to drone out of the bowels of the engine room.</p><p>The attackers were getting closer now, firing with all available weapons. The first barrage tore down the shields and lanced into the lone Freelancer’s armor plating, setting off alarm sirens on Nano’s console. The vect silenced them with a gesture.</p><p>“It looks like they’re splitting up to get at us from the sides. Rami, keep the shield facing their Smuggler. Mek, take down those Privateers, now!”</p><p>Fighting to keep up with the evasive maneuvers of his targets, Mekhet-Nu could only score one hit with his second salvo; the damaged Privateer retaining just enough structural integrity to remain a threat. Meanwhile, auto turret shots continued to impact their port side.</p><p>“I’m doing the best I can, Nano,” the monk replied, eyes still glued to his screens. “Damage?”</p><p>“Nothing too bad yet, but I think they’ve got the same idea about charging their arcane cannon…”</p><p>Rami’s voice came on the intercom, saying “Don’t worry kids, there’s no way they’ve got a wizard out here who can go toe to toe with me for long!” Presently, a blizzard of icy shards blasted out of the Freelancer’s arcane cannon, obliterating the undamaged Privateer and ripping into the frontal armor of the lead Firm ship. The small firebolt they produced in reply was off target, and things suddenly looked a lot better for the three thieves.</p><p>The Firm ships kept up the chase for a short time, firing a few more desultory volleys, but Mekhet-Nu’s accurate fire soon eliminated the second Privateer and forced the last, crippled survivor to disengage.</p><p>“Hey Rami, you’ve still got that map to Garfeckt’s hoard, right?” Nano asked, preparing to chart a new—and even more dangerous— course. “Let’s lay in the coordinates.”</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Be it for planet-hopping exploration, high-stakes smuggling, or white-knuckle dogfighting, no campaign in Dark Matter is complete without a starship.

Even ships laid down in the same yard to the same specification are likely to go through multiple refits, overhauls, and repairs during their lives, leaving them unrecognizable after a few years in the Black. For most purposes, ships are described by statistics which include the following information: Size classification, hit points, shield points, Armor Class, engines, systems, crew, cargo, cost, challenge, and weapons, all of which are detailed below. More details for how these statistics are used can be found in the Ship Combat section.</p><h1>Size Classification</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>The Rule of 100</h4><p>In many ways, the rules of space combat are the same as regular combat, but bigger. If you’re not sure how to create new stats or how to interpret an effect happening at starship scale, remember that hit points and damage (which use mega points), movement speed, and ship scale are generally scaled up by 100 times. This can provide a good rule of thumb when a quick decision is necessary at the table.</p></div><p>Ships are categorized according to their <strong>Size Classification</strong>, which generally determines other important aspects: its crew size, top speed outside of void jumps, maneuverability, and durability. For example, a larger ship might be able to carry more men and guns, but a smaller ship can outrun and outmaneuver it. Different size classifications are detailed in the Size Classification table below.</p><p>Ships also mention which race generally builds that type of ship. This has no mechanical effect on its own; instead, it gives an impression about which types of creatures might be piloting them, and what statistics you can expect from that type of ship. For example, Hammers, which are dwarven fighters, are sturdily built, and possess a higher Armor Class than many other fighters as a result.</p><p>Additionally, the Ship Classification table indicates the size of a ship in feet and its size using the optional Grid Combat rules. The sizes listed are maximum sizes.</p><h3>Character Level</h3><p>A typical adventuring party might begin their adventures with a modest personal ship and invest in larger, more capable vessels as their fortunes grow. Larger parties, however, will find the cargo space and crew capacity of a transport ship essential. At very high levels, characters might enlist a crew to man a frigate or even an entire fleet.</p><p>In general, a party’s character level has no bearing on ship size (and by extension, ship combat power), but a GM can award a party with larger ships as they grow in level. As such, the Ship Classification table also includes a recommended character level for some ship sizes.</p><h4>Size Classification</h4><table><thead><tr><td><em><strong>Classification</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Dimension (feet)</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Dimension (squares)</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Rec.

Unlike creatures, however, a ship’s Armor Class is perfectly literal: it represents how heavily armored a ship is and determines how successful an attack is likely to be.</p><h3>Mega Hit Points</h3><p>The damage necessary to injure and kill the hardiest of men is paltry compared to the durability and lethality of an entire starship. Therefore, ships use Mega Hit Points, instead of regular hit points, to describe their damage and repair. A single mega hit point equals 100 hit points. A ship’s hit points represent the resilience of its hull.</p><h3>Shield Points</h3><p>In addition to hit points, many ships have Shield Points, (expressed in mega points) which determine how much damage can be absorbed by the ship's shield. Shields are always created by a shield generator system and are controlled by the ship’s engineer.</p><h3>Engines</h3><p>Ships generally have two <strong>Engine</strong> types, a Dark Matter engine to perform void jumps, and an Impulse engine, used to maneuver when not in the Void. Each impulse engine has a given <strong>Speed</strong> in hundreds of feet per turn and a <strong>Maneuverability</strong> score, measured in degrees, which determines a ship's cone of movement.</p><p>More information about engines can be found in the Dark Matter Engines section, and more information about movement can be found in the Ship Combat section.</p><h3>Systems</h3><p>Everything from essentials, like a ship’s life support or sensors, to peripheral functions, like tractor beams and teleporters are encapsulated in a ship’s Systems. The list of systems available to a ship are detailed in the Systems section.</p><h3>Crew</h3><p>The ship's Crew indicates the roles that are available to characters in the ship. If a Dogfighter role is available, the entry in parentheses indicates the default type of ship that the dogfighters pilot. For more information on how to use the crew roles, see the Ship Combat section. Note that most ships will have room for passengers that won't actively take a role in ship combat.</p><p>If the need arises, a ship can temporarily take on more passengers than it can safely support. Doing so taxes the life-support, however, and can only be performed for a short time. For each day that the ship is above its passenger capacity, every passenger onboard gains one level of exhaustion. These levels of exhaustion can’t be removed by those aboard until the ship is once again below capacity.</p><h3>Cargo</h3><p>Each ship has a fixed Cargo capacity, which indicates the amount of cargo the ship can carry.</p><h3>Cost</h3><p>Most ships can be bought and sold at docks and starports throughout the ‘verse, and therefore have an included <strong>Cost</strong>. This price is a typical figure for a ship of its type, but unscrupulous (or simply ignorant) merchants might sell ships for a far higher or far lower price.</p><p>Not all ships have an included cost; the very largest and most powerful of ships are ostensibly priceless and are never bought or sold at market.</p><h3>Challenge</h3><p>Like monsters, ships have a <strong>Challenge</strong> rating to help GMs compose challenging encounters using them. When determining encounter difficulty, it is best to use the average of the party’s level and their ship’s challenge rating as the party’s effective level.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Ship-mounted weaponry comes in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes, from physical battering rams, to extremely large flamethrowers, to deployable mines, but the most common ship-mounted <strong>Weapons</strong> are based on the same principles as handheld blasters. They are, nonetheless, singularly destructive, capable of melting clean through armored hulls in a single shot.</p><p>Ship armaments are explained in the Ship Weapons section, with additional details on their use in the Ship Combat section.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":850000,"name":"Ship Table (by

Combat","type":"text","_id":"5HkOBkQuM3psisMk","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Combat between starships is a deadly and unforgiving game, for the loser is subjected to the lifeless, infinite void of space.</p><p>Ship combat follows most of the same rules and conventions as ordinary combat; for example, ships follow an initiative order and generally play on a 2D plane.</p><p>Ship movement is covered in the Pilot role and ship attacks are covered in the Gunner role. The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.</p><h2>Initiative</h2><p>When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order.</p><h2>Character Roles</h2><p>Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character.</p><p>A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.</p><h3>Captain</h3><p>As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.</p><p>As a captain, you can use the following actions:</p><p><em><strong>Boarding Party</strong></em>. When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.</p><p><em><strong>Brace for Impact</strong></em>. You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</p><p><em><strong>Deep Scan</strong></em>. If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.</p><p><em><strong>Fire at Will</strong></em>. You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Full Speed Ahead</strong></em>. You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.</p><h3>Dogfighter</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“Always make sure you have a William or a Willy on your crew.”</p><p>— Lightweight, nautilid sepulcher knight, gunner, and self\u0002proclaimed humorist</p></blockquote></div><p>You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship.</p><p>Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules as the Pilot’s Move action and the Gunner’s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot’s Dogfighting action.</p><p>If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.</p><p>While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action:</p><p><em><strong>Targeted Attack</strong></em>. While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship’s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship’s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship’s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship’s hit points.</p><p>If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.</p><h3>Engineer</h3><p>As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active.</p><p>The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points.</p><p>At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up.</p><p>As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:</p><p><em><strong>Directing Power</strong></em>. You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship’s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship’s engines, the ship’s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship’s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action.</p><p>Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship’s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</p><p><em><strong>Overcharge</strong></em>. If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship’s engines (increasing the ship’s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again for 1 minute.</p><p><em><strong>System Repair</strong></em>. You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Void Jump</strong></em>. You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Blind Jump table when the jump begins.</p><h3>Gunner</h3><p>Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted.</p><p>While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship’s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons.</p><p>You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship’s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon’s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC.</p><p>As a gunner, you can take the following actions:</p><p><em><strong>Open Fire</strong></em>. You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship’s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks. If you score a critical hit on a ship, you randomly disable one of the target ship's systems.</p><p><em><strong>Readied Attack</strong></em>. You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship’s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.</p><h3>Pilot</h3><p>As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. Additionally, each ship <strong>faces</strong> a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions.</p><p>To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a <strong>cone of movement</strong>, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship’s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees.</p><p>As the ship’s pilot, you can use the following actions:</p><p><em><strong>Move</strong></em>. You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship’s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score.</p><p><em><strong>Evasive Maneuvers</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.</p><p><em><strong>Dogfighting</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same.</p><p><em><strong>Hard Turn</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose.</p><p><em><strong>Match Speed</strong></em>. Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends.</p><p><em><strong>Ram</strong></em>. If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature’s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.</p><h2>Damage and Repair</h2><p>A ship’s hit points are given in mega points and ship\u0002based weapons usually deal damage in mega points as well. Optionally, the GM can rule that non-mega damage can’t affect things which have mega hit points, and that mega damage is instantly lethal to non-mega targets.</p><p>When a ship takes hit point damage, it represents structural damage to its hull which is not easily repaired. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship’s capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points. Individual systems and weapons, however, can be disabled by precision strikes, which is separate from normal hit point damage.</p><p>Ships are immune to poison and psychic damage.</p><p><em><strong>Shield Points</strong></em>. If a ship has a shield generator, hit point damage might instead be subtracted from the ship’s shield points (SP), which are measured in mega hit points. Shields only cover a part of a ship, normally only one side. If the shortest line from an attacker to a shielded ship lands on a shielded side (or a corner of a shielded side), damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points. If an attack reduces the shield to 0 shield points, any excess damage carries over to hit points.</p><p>A ship with a shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up, at the beginning of the engineer’s turn (or the start of the initiative order, if the ship has no engineer).</p><h3>Destruction</h3><p>When a ship drops to 0 hit points, it becomes a blazing wreck. All of its systems, including weapons, engines, and life support, cease to function, and it can’t regain hit points. Escape craft, like fighters, life pods, and shuttles can still eject from a blazing wreck. The ship is on a tipping point of complete disaster; it might soon explode outright, or otherwise become a derelict wreck.</p><p><em><strong>Explosion Saving Throws</strong></em>. If the ship is a blazing wreck at the end of the initiative order, one character makes a unique saving throw, called an explosion saving throw. This saving throw isn’t tied to any ability score; it is purely dependent on chance.</p><p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, the ship becomes a derelict wreck; it is adrift, and all its systems are still disabled, but it is no longer at risk of exploding and can, with extensive efforts, be repaired. On your third failure, the ship explodes, immediately killing any creatures still onboard. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.</p><p><em><strong>Damage at 0 Hit Points</strong></em>. If your ship takes any damage while it is a blazing wreck, it suffers an explosion saving throw failure.</p><h3>Repair</h3><p>Repairing a ship is a difficult process requiring many hours of work. During your downtime, you can perform repairs on your ship. For each day you spend performing repairs, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. If you have proficiency in ship maintenance tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check, or double your proficiency bonus if you are also proficient with Technology. On a success, the ship regains mega hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, the ship can be repaired completely in one day at port for a fee of 2 gp per mega hit point lost.</p><h3>Boarding</h3><p>Sometimes, your objective in ship-to-ship combat requires that you come aboard a hostile vessel. You can board another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so, any number of crew members or passengers can join a boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.</p><p>A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat.</p><p>The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus and can only return to their own ship through the umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons.</p><p>If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it.</p><h3>NPC Ships</h3><p>The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen.</p><p>If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn.</p><p>Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions include when one or more player characters has boarded the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship’s explosion.</p><h3>Variant Rule: Grid Combat</h3><p>Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.</p><p>When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</p><h3>Variant Rule: Planes of Movement</h3><p>Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many <strong>Planes of Movement</strong> exist. In open space, there might be three to four, while in orbit around a star, there may only be two.</p><p>When moving your ship, you can expend 1,000 feet of movement to move up or down one Plane of Movement (doing so also moves you 500 feet forward in your cone of movement). When you target ships in other planes of movement, they are treated as being an additional 500 feet away for each plane of movement between your ship and the target. Two ships can pass above or below one another in the same space while in different planes of movement.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Dark Matter Engines","type":"text","_id":"UgCcSPUJbYzpmIvz","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Spacefaring vessels in the 'verse are abundant and varied, reflecting hundreds of societies and their diverse technologies. Nearly all of them operate via a Dark Matter engine, a solid or latticework crystal structure surrounded by heat sinks, stabilizers, and other supporting equipment. These engines are powered by magic, allowing them to carry a ship on short jumps through the Void to cross vast gulfs of space.</p><p>Dark Matter engines are the hearts of starships. Most ships also have other engines, called impulse engines, to travel outside of void jumps, but a Dark Matter engine is required to embark on any planet-hopping adventure.</p><h3>Engine Class</h3><p>Dark Matter engines can only jump twice a day, and most can maintain a void jump for only a short time before needing time to cool down and recharge. Therefore, Dark Matter engines are organized into Classes, from 1 – 9, based upon the length of their jumps. These Classes are detailed in the Dark Matter Engine Classes table.</p><p>If a spellcaster directly powers the engine using their magic, they can cause a Dark Matter engine to jump two more times on a given day. However, progressively more powerful engines require more arcane magic. A Class 1 engine can be powered by a 1st level spell slot, but a Class 2 engine requires a 2nd level spell slot, and so on.</p><p>Engines with the lowest classes are ostensibly system\u0002hoppers, allowing a small starship to jump around a single system, or to go on longer journeys between nearby systems. Often, these types of ships will need to be carried within higher class starships to cross longer distances.</p><p>Class 10 engines are strictly theoretical or legendary, depending on who you ask. Such an engine could cross the galaxy in a single day, requiring no spellcasters of any sort, and would have to be the direct creation of the gods, or some ancient, mystical alien race.</p><h3>Void Crystals</h3><p>Dark Matter engines are constructed with void crystals at their cores. Rare, fragile, and extracted from the Void at the event horizons of black holes, these crystals are among the most valuable and volatile materials in the 'verse. If a void crystal is damaged in the slightest, it risks not only becoming inoperable, but also collapsing into a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, destroying the rest of the engine and the entire ship. Thus, most of the stabilizing equipment surrounding the core of a Dark Matter engine serves only to insulate and protect the crystal within.</p><h3>Running a Dark Matter Engine</h3><p>To many, it seems that Dark Matter engines are temperamental and perplexing without end, behaving like living things unto themselves. No single race’s designs and no particular model accurately represents the variety of these engines; even engines of the same model act differently when fed different types of magical energy. When a ship has long had a warlock working as an engineer, the Dark Matter engine may start to belch clouds of sulfur and brimstone, and charge faster when those aboard the ship are miserable. Wizards, on the other hand, keep rather tidy, if meticulously modified, engines, which are likely to pulse with rhythmic bursts of force when engaged in a jump. The variations are endless: engines run by illusionists chromatically aberrate the air around them, druid-kept engines sprout twigs and grass in their crevices, and some dwarven engines produce a small amount of beer as exhaust.</p><p><em><strong>Charging a Dark Matter Engine.</strong></em> All Dark Matter engines, regardless of type, require significant energy to charge-up before a jump. Older or worn models of engine can take several hours of warm-up time, during which they must be fed a continuous stream of magical energy. In general, assume that an engine requires 1 minute of warm-up time prior to a jump.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Ship Weapons","type":"text","_id":"GPrjU46Voo5v46es","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Ship-mounted weapons are among the most lethal devices ever conceived. A direct shot with any of these massive weapons can vaporize an unprotected person, but no less is necessary to pierce the armored hull of a starship.</p><p>Ship-mounted weapons are used by crewmen in the Gunner role. A character with martial weapons proficiency also has proficiency with ship weapons.</p><p>Ship weapon damages are given in mega damage points.</p><h2>Weapon Descriptions</h2><p>These weapons are installed in ships across the ‘verse, from amoeboid saucers to human warbringers.</p><p><em><strong>Auto Turret</strong></em>. This omni-directional twin blaster is fired from a swiveling, domed turret. Because of its rotating mount, the blaster is relatively small compared to other ship-mounted weapons, but it is capable of harrying other vessels from all angles.</p><p><em><strong>Antimatter Mine</strong></em>. Antimatter mines are explosives designed to lay dormant until magnetically attracted to nearby targets. Each mine weighs around 1,000 pounds and are deployed from a launch tube, normally installed near a ship’s cargo bay.</p><p><em><strong>Heavy Cannon</strong></em>. Ballistic weapons are uncommon in space combat, but not totally unheard of (and certainly not ineffective). A heavy cannon fires large-diameter explosive shells, which unlike blaster bolts, must lead their target to account for travel time.</p><p><em><strong>Light Cannon</strong></em>. Scaled-down versions of heavy cannons, light cannons trade sheer firepower for a faster rate of fire, greater density of stored ammunition, and more flexibility in mounting positions.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning Coil</strong></em>. This enormous transformer draws a similarly large amount of power and generates arcs of lightning thousands of feet long. Because the lightning discharges toward any nearby target, the lightning coil is actually omni-directional.</p><p><em><strong>Mining Laser</strong></em>. This laser and its turret deploy from a hatch on the ship, with a blast screen protecting it from loose debris. If allowed to focus on an immobile target, the laser grows hot enough to break chunks from solid asteroids.</p><p><em><strong>Neutron Torpedo</strong></em>. This cigar-shaped missile carries a hefty neutron payload to its target. Unfortunately, the torpedo only carries a limited amount of fuel, limiting its maximum range.</p><p><em><strong>Pulse Cannon.</strong></em> One of the staple fixed-position blasters, the pulse cannon charges an incredible burst of energy in a large capacitor bank, before releasing it in a brilliant flicker of light. This weapon owes its popularity to its balance of firepower and range.</p><p><em><strong>Railgun</strong></em>. Conducting a ferromagnetic projectile down two conductive rails requires a frankly outrageous amount of power, but the results are hard to argue with. A railgun transfers so much kinetic energy into its projectile that it generally degrades into plasma en route to its target.</p><p><em><strong>Scorcher</strong></em>. Scorchers spit a narrow fan of flame from their mouths, normally with the intent of melting through the hulls of other ships or making them malleable enough to warp. Because of this uncouth design, scorchers trade range for the singular ability to bypass shield systems.</p><p><em><strong>Starbuster</strong></em>. Starbusters are the largest blasters ever fashioned. By channeling six component blasters into a single, mighty beam, this weapon can rend entire ships in half. Its scale and power consumption mean that only the grandest of ships can shoulder it; of course, this also means that this weapon is as useful for deterrence as it is for defense.</p><h2>Ship Weapon Properties</h2><p>In addition to weapon properties presented in the Equipment chapter, shipbound weapons have special properties that are unique to their use.</p><p><em><strong>Deployable</strong></em>. A deployable weapon releases a type of ammunition that separates from the ship, which might have a movement speed of its own, noted in parentheses.</p><p>When you make an attack using one of these weapons, you deploy the weapon within your ship’s space. You make an attack roll using this weapon when it contacts another ship.</p><p>If you use a deployable weapon that has a movement speed, you can choose the direction it travels as a bonus action on your turn. A deployable weapon has a maneuverability of 90 degrees and begins facing in the same direction as the ship. Once a deployable weapon moves for 3 turns, it deactivates and begins drifting listlessly.</p><p>Deployable weapons can be targeted independently during flight. Each of these weapons has Armor Class 10 and 1 mega hit point.</p><p><em><strong>Fixed</strong></em>. This weapon is mounted on one side of a ship and can only make attacks against targets within a 90-degree cone in the direction it is facing.</p><p><em><strong>Ship</strong></em>. A ship weapon is powered by a ship and must be mounted to one to fire. This weapon can’t target any creature or object that is Huge or smaller.</p><h2>Special Weapons</h2><p>These ship weapons have special properties.</p><p><em><strong>Antimatter Mine.</strong></em> If a ship other than your own with a Dark Matter engine comes within 1,000 feet of this mine, the mine detonates. When this happens, make an attack roll with the mine against the triggering ship.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning Coil.</strong></em> This weapon deals double damage to shield points, but half damage (rounded down) to hit points. If this damage reduces a ship’s shields points to 0, remaining damage is not subtracted from hit points.</p><p><em><strong>Mining Laser.</strong></em> This weapon is designed to cut through immobile asteroids and other bodies of rock. It deals double damage to targets that have not moved in the last round.</p><p><em><strong>Scorcher.</strong></em> This weapon produces a scorching fan of arcane energy which heats a ship’s hull without affecting its shields. Shields do not block this weapon's damage.</p><h2>Ammunition and Deployable Weapons</h2><p>Many ship weapons rely on blaster technology, which are powered strictly by the ship’s Dark Matter engine, and don't require ammunition of any sort. Other ship weapons (especially those favored by gnomes) are more closely related to firearms in design and require ammunition, or deploy from the ship and fly independently, almost like separate vehicles. Ammunition and deployable weapons have independent costs and must be purchased separately.</p><table style=\"width:250px\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Weapon</strong></td><td><strong>Cost</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antimatter Mine</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Light Cannon Round</td><td>10 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy Cannon Round</td><td>15 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Nuetron Torpedo</td><td>75 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Broadside Attacks</h2><p>The largest of ships, which are equipped with dozens of guns, don't so much fire them independently as they do shell an entire area. This is called a broadside attack. When a ship makes a broadside attack, each mega creature and the pilot of each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking full damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Broadside attacks require a gunner, much like other attacks.</p><p>A broadside attack can only be used once on each round. If a broadside attack is disabled, it can still be used to make an attack, but deals only half damage on a failed saving throw, and no damage on a successful save.</p><p>A ship with broadside attacks can’t replace them with other ship weapons.</p><h2>Ship Melee Weapons</h2><p>Some ships have tremendous built-in melee weapons, designed to crush, rip, and tear other ships into pieces. For use in especially close range, these weapons can target any other ship or mega creature in an adjacent square (a target within 500 feet). Ship melee weapons can’t be replaced like normal ship weapons, nor can they replace normal ship weapons.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"Systems","type":"text","_id":"8hhB18DhpQF6dZA7","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>A ship relies on a myriad of technological systems to provide most of its noncombative functions.

If a strategic attack on a system reduces it to 0 hit points, it is disabled and doesn't function until it is repaired (generally requiring the work of a trained engineer).</p><p>The costs to install new systems are found on the System Costs table below. Additional rules regarding installing new systems are in the Customizing your Ship section.</p><h4>System Costs</h4><table style=\"width:250px\"><thead><tr><td><em><strong>System</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Cost</strong></em></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Arcane Cannon</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Cloaking</td><td>16,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Communications</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Fabricator</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Hypercapacitor</td><td>7,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Life Pods</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Life Support</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Probe</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Sensors</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Shield Generator</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Shuttle</td><td>1,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Sickbay</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Simulator</td><td>6,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Teleporters</td><td>20,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Tractor Beam</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Umbilicus</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Arcane Cannon</h3><p>This immensely sophisticated station focuses and magnifies a spellcaster’s power, allowing them to cast spells that lay waste to entire fleets.To use an arcane cannon, you must be a spellcaster and be in the Gunner role. The cannon allows you to see ships as if you were on the bridge, which enables you to target ships with spells.</p><p>To use the arcane cannon, you must first use your action to charge it for one round. Charging the cannon doesn't expend a spell slot, but if the cannon is not used on the next round, it discharges harmlessly and must be charged again.</p><p>If you use your action to cast an evocation spell into the charged arcane cannon, you can choose a ship as a target instead of a creature. The spell must have a duration of Instantaneous and a range of 5 feet or greater. The GM can decide if a spell is inappropriate to be magnified by the cannon.</p><p>The arcane cannon transforms the spell into a mega spell; as such, this spell fails if it is cast within an area of gravitation. Its range and the dimensions of its spell effects are multiplied by 100, to a maximum range of 10,000 feet. Also, the spell deals mega damage instead of normal damage.</p><p>If a spell cast through the arcane cannon targeting a ship calls for a saving throw, the pilot makes that saving throw on behalf of the ship itself. Abilities like Evasion don't affect this type of saving throw.</p><h3>Cloaking</h3><p>The engineer must use their action to activate or deactivate this system, causing the ship to become invisible or to return to visibility. This invisibility ends if your ship attacks, takes damage, moves more than 500 feet on its turn, or if anyone aboard the ship casts a spell or uses a system (such as a teleporter) that penetrates the ship’s hull. The ship can be invisible for a total of 5 minutes each day, though this time doesn't need to be used in consecutive turns. This time recharges 24 hours after use.</p><h3>Communications</h3><p>For two ships to communicate, they must both have a functioning communications system and be within 1,000 miles of one another. This system normally transmits only audio communication, and most systems also translate it to the listener’s language, as per the tongues spell (though older models and those in disrepair are less likely to have this feature).</p><h3>Fabricator</h3><p>Though most ships carry rations for long journeys, many employ a magic fabricator which replicates the effects of the create food and water spell to provide a reliable source of nourishment for the entire crew. Indeed, many view this type of system as being a part of life support itself.</p><p>Some ships use even more sophisticated replicators, capable of not only creating food and drink, but also capable of manufacturing just about anything, as per the fabricate spell. Though these more sophisticated systems are phenomenally expensive, they’re essential for the largest of ships, which contain innumerable parts which can fail at a moment’s notice. Any ship of Corvette size or larger with this system can be expected to have the fabricate version of this system installed.</p><h3>Hypercapacitor</h3><p>A hypercapacitor is an immense secondary power cell, which slowly charges itself until it contains a staggering quantity of arcane energy. The engineer can discharge the hypercapacitor in place of supplying a spell slot of 5th level or lower to power a void jump or overcharge the engine. Once discharged, it takes 24 hours to charge, but a spellcaster can use their action and expend a spell slot of the same level as the Dark Matter engine’s class to charge it early. A ship can have no more than two hypercapacitors installed at one time.</p><h3>Life Pods</h3><p>In the event of catastrophic ship failure, life pods are the last hope for survival. A ship with this system has a single\u0002person life pod for each crew member and passenger. At any time, you can use your action to board a life pod and eject from the ship. The pod travels far enough to clear any explosion of the ship, then drifts aimlessly. The pod has extremely minimal thrusters—enough to change direction two or three times—and enough air, power, and rations to sustain its passenger for 7 days. Each life pod automatically produces a distress signal that can be detected by any ship with sensors, though such a signal only travels at the speed of light—very slow by galactic scale. A life pod can survive reentry on most planets.</p><h3>Life Support</h3><p>Providing a ship with air, heat, and artificial gravity, a life support system is the most integral part of a ship for its crew. If a life support system is disabled, a temporary life support system will typically be engaged, providing the ship with air and heat for up to an hour, but not restoring artificial gravity.</p><p>For less conventional starships, such as those shaped as galleons or which are built within great trees, the life support system extends a bubble of heat and atmosphere around the entire ship.</p><p>It is possible to survive for some time without a functioning life support system, as long as crew members have functioning life suits, but these alternatives are frequently a temporary stop-gap while the life support is repaired.</p><p>A crew member with sufficient privileges with the ship computer aboard the bridge of a ship can normally disable the life support manually as an action. Depending on the ship, this may allow them to vent atmosphere from the ship, disable the artificial gravity (rendering the entire ship a zero-gravity environment, if it’s in space), disable the ship’s heaters, or do all of those things to all or part of the ship.</p><h3>Probe</h3><p>This remotely piloted drone is deployed from the ship to analyze potentially hazardous environments ahead of the ship itself. The probe has no combat capabilities but transmits everything it sees and hears back to its controller. If the probe strays more than 100 miles from the controller, it loses connection and falls dormant until the controller unit is within signal range. The statistics for a probe are included in the Example Ships section.</p><h3>Sensors</h3><p>The vast majority of ships are equipped with an array of sensors used to pinpoint ships and other obstacles within 100 miles. If these sensors are missing or disabled, a ship can only see and make attacks within its cone of movement.</p><h3>Shield Generator</h3><p>A massive arcane projector, pulsing with waves of abjuration magic, a shield generator is required for a ship to have a directional shield. If it is disabled, a ship loses all of its shield points until it is repaired.</p><h3>Shuttle</h3><p>Like fighters, shuttles are smaller ships which can be deployed from a parent ship as an action to perform a number of operations. Whereas fighters are strictly offensive, however, shuttles aren't typically equipped with weapons, and can instead hold a more sizable crew and a larger capacity of cargo. Shuttles are usually used to ferry people and goods between the main ship and a planet’s surface, and make for a cheap and effective alternative to teleportation. The statistics for a shuttle are included in the Example Ships section.</p><h3>Sickbay</h3><p>Illness and injury are bound to happen on a starship, and without a dedicated healer onboard, a sickbay is a critical facility on any starship. This system has a pool of 6 medical dice, which are d8s. Each of these dice recharge 24 hours after being used. You can spend 1 minute in a sickbay and expend one or more of these dice to cause you or another creature in the sickbay to regain hit points equal to the value rolled.</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 3 medical dice to cure yourself of any disease or poison afflicting you or another creature in the sickbay.</p><h3>Simulator</h3><p>Because voyages aboard a starship can last months or even years at a time, simulating the luxuries of home can be a great boon to the crew's morale. A simulator is an immensely complex room, technically a sentient magic item, that employs dozens of systems to create the effects of the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.sTIkQK7KuQNOyY0C]{hallucinatory terrain}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.nslx2nT3p4lNkmdp]{major image}</em> to replicate entire environments and situations. Though this system was designed to train crew members for dangerous situations and to simulate tactical battles, it is just as often employed for entertainment purposes.</p><h3>Teleporters</h3><p>Blinking from the inside of a ship onto the surface of a planet is an invaluable function for many starships. As such, many ships contain a number of permanent <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{teleportation circles}</em> specially designed for this type of short-range transportation. The ship’s engineer can use their action to activate the teleportation system, targeting a single unmoving location within 100 miles of the ship and creating a temporary destination teleportation circle at that location. This circle lasts for 1 minute or until another teleportation circle is created. Because the resonance of a Dark Matter engine interferes with the teleportation magic, you can’t create a destination circle inside a ship which has a functioning Dark Matter engine unless engineers on both ships coordinate the teleporters to allow transit.</p><p>Sometimes, a network of teleportation circles will be set up inside particularly large ships to facilitate quick navigation. Such teleporters are constantly active.</p><h3>Tractor Beam</h3><p>A tractor beam is a very large device designed to pull spacecraft and other objects toward the ship. If you are in the Engineer role, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack using a tractor beam. The target must be an object or ship within 3,000 feet that is less than half the size of your ship and isn't moving away from it. If you are not a spellcaster, you only add your proficiency bonus to this attack roll.</p><p>On a hit, the target is caught in the tractor beam. At the beginning of each of your turns, you can use your action to maintain the beam and pull the target up to 500 feet closer to your ship. The target can’t otherwise move while it is within the tractor beam.</p><p>If the target is a ship, it can attempt to break free of the tractor beam. The pilot of the target ship can make a Dexterity (Piloting) check on its turn, opposed by your Intelligence (Technology) check. If you fail, the ship uses half its movement speed to escape the tractor beam and can move freely for the remainder of its movement.</p><h3>Umbilicus</h3><p>An umbilicus is a long, hollow cable which extends from one ship to another (a maximum of 100 feet), allowing the transport of people and goods between the two without compromising the hull of either ship. An umbilicus is required to board another ship.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Customizing Your Ship","type":"text","_id":"9n7YqHEXHwb1j3fg","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>As parts fail and repairs are made in the Black, most ships start to look less and less like their original factory models and more like customized Frankenstein ships, composed of parts from dozens of vessels, strapped to a vaguely familiar frame. Sometimes, these sorts of repairs are necessary to keep the ship operating, but other times, they’re optional, made solely to upgrade the original model in desirable ways. There are four general varieties of customizations you can give a ship: upgrading a ship’s Dark Matter engine, replacing weapons, adding new systems, and other general upgrades. You can install two or more upgrades at the same time, as long as you have access to a spaceport and enough people to install all the upgrades simultaneously.</p><h2>Upgrading a Dark Matter Engine</h2><p>Installing a new Dark Matter engine is no trivial task. The void crystals at the core of a Dark Matter engine are extremely fragile and must be in pristine condition to operate correctly. If an engine is installed incorrectly, the void crystals will likely be damaged, resulting in an immediate (or delayed) instability event, consuming the ship and all aboard it in a sphere of annihilation. Often, automatons will perform most of the testing after trained engineers have installed the crystals.</p><p>Despite the risk and the cost, you can upgrade a ship’s Dark Matter engine by 1 class (or install a Class 1 Dark Matter engine into a ship that didn’t have one) with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown on the Dark Matter Upgrade table. Upgrading a Dark Matter engine on a ship larger than a frigate is generally impossible, as larger engines are too deeply interconnected to the ship to be replaced.</p><h4>Dark Matter Upgrade</h4><table style=\"width:250px;\"><thead><tr><td><em><strong>Ship Size</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Cost</strong></em></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fighter</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Personal</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Transport</td><td>12,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Corvette</td><td>25,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Frigate</td><td>37,500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Upgrading Weapons</h2><p>The ideal ship would have dozens of weapons installed on every external surface, covering every possible direction with extreme firepower. Reality, however, gets in the way. Because each weapon needs a gunner, each external weapon is linked to a single gunner station on the inside of the ship. Unfortunately, this means most ships can’t install additional weapons—doing so would require a complete overhaul of the ship’s internal layout.</p><p>It is relatively simple, however, to replace one ship weapon with another. Doing so requires 1 day of work and the cost of the weapon to be installed. Removed weapons can be kept in storage (though most are massively heavy and spacious) or sold at half market value.</p><p>You can also change the mounting location of a facing weapon with 8 hours of work, choosing for the weapon to be installed facing the front, back, left, or right of the ship.</p><h2>Adding New Systems</h2><p>Ships have a wide variety of systems at their disposal, expanding their capabilities and comforts, making them both powerful weapons and cozy homes. Ships have room to install three additional systems before space on board becomes a significant problem. However, fighter\u0002sized ships have much tighter space, and have no room for additional systems. After the maximum number of systems are installed, new systems can only be installed by removing other systems from the ship.</p><p>Installing a shield generator on a ship that doesn't have one gives that ship 8 shield points.</p><p>You can install a new system with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown on the System Costs table.</p><h2>Other Upgrades</h2><p>Starships can be outfitted with an array of upgrades that aren’t as modular as replacing a weapon or adding a new system. Each of the following upgrades can be installed on a ship once, unless otherwise specified. You can install a new system with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown in the Ship Upgrades table.</p><h3>Ship Upgrades</h3><p>The following upgrades are listed in alphabetical order.</p><table style=\"width:250px;\"><thead><tr><td><em><strong>System</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Cost</strong></em></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Afterburners</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>AI Core</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Antivirus Module</td><td>750 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Arcana-Resistant Coating</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Assault Port</td><td>3,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Captain’s Chair</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Countermeasures</td><td>1,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Cruising Engines</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Ded Reckone</td><td>r 3,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Detonation Failsafe</td><td>4,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Expanded Hold</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Expanded Quarters</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>External Manipulators</td><td>2,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Internal Reinforcements</td><td>1,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Jump Rift</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Lifeform Scanner</td><td>3,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Live Feed</td><td>750 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Material Analyzer</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Medical Station</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Overshield</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Panic Drive</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Radio Array</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Reinforced Hull</td><td>4,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Repair Drones</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Targeting Optics</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Tri-Probe</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Smuggler’s Hold</td><td>750 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Afterburners.</strong></em> Your ship’s movement speed increases by 500 feet if the pilot moves it in a straight line.</p><p><em><strong>AI Core.</strong></em> Your ship's computer has an installed construct core that manifests a sentient shipboard artificial intelligence. This AI serves to keep the ship in running order and has some interaction with all of the ship's systems, allowing it to see and hear every part of the ship and control all of its systems. It can communicate with the ship's passengers via the ship's computer system and any built-in intercom systems on the ship.</p><p>The AI has an Intelligence of 17, a Charisma of 14, and a Wisdom of 13. It is proficient in Technology (+5) and Data (+5). It can make Intelligence checks when any situation arises and will inform its passengers of any information it knows.</p><p>Additionally, at a crew member's command, the AI can directly assume any character role aboard the ship. The AI can perform any action provided by that role, taking its turn at the end of the initiative order. The ship adds +3 to all of its attack rolls.</p><p>AI personalities can vary wildly. Some are snarky and occasionally play jokes on their crew, while others are fiercely logical and derive pleasure chiefly from calculating probabilities to dozens of decimal places. All, however, generally enjoy their hulls and decks being cleaned regularly.</p><p><em><strong>Antivirus Module</strong></em>. Your ship has a secondary arcane terminal which screens all access to the ship computer for hacking attempts. Any attempt to hack the ship’s computer or any system or door control has disadvantage.</p><p><em><strong>Arcana-Resistant Coating</strong></em>. Any crew member that must make a saving throw to resist a magic effect originating from outside the ship can add +2 to the roll.</p><p><em><strong>Assault Port</strong></em>. Dogfighters can deploy from your ship as a bonus action, rather than an action.</p><p>Your ship must have the Dogfighter role to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Captain’s Chair</strong></em>. Your ship comes equipped with a luxurious command chair, laden with communication controls and a single prominent red button. The captain can take one of their special actions as a bonus action, and regains the ability to do so after 24 hours. The captain can’t take the same special action twice on the same turn.</p><p>Your ship must have the Captain role to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Countermeasures</strong></em>. Your ship has a series of flares or a deployable decoy designed to confuse the targeting of a pursuing vessel. You can trigger your countermeasures as a reaction when you are targeted by an attack, causing that attack to have disadvantage. Once you use your countermeasures, you must load a new set in a process which takes 1 minute.</p><p>Your ship must be fighter-sized to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Cruising Engines</strong></em>. Your ship’s sublight speed is doubled.</p><p><em><strong>Ded Reckoner</strong></em>. Your ship has a complex flight computer, which attempts to calculate a course through the Void. When you make a blind void jump, you can add +5 to the roll.</p><p>Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Detonation Failsafe</strong></em>. Your ship is less likely to suffer catastrophic failure and has advantage on detonation saving throws.</p><p><em><strong>Expanded Hold</strong></em>. Your ship’s cargo capacity increases by 50%.</p><p><em><strong>Expanded Quarters</strong></em>. Your ship can hold 25% more passengers (rounded up) above its normal capacity without overly taxing the life support during long voyages.</p><p><em><strong>External Manipulators</strong></em>. A pair of extensible clawed arms can fold out from the hull of your ship or fold down again as an action. These arms can reach up 50 feet and can each push, pull, or grip with a maximum force of 1,000 pounds.</p><p><em><strong>Internal Reinforcements</strong></em>. You have improved the integrity of your fighter by filling every hollow space with lightweight reinforcements. Your fighter’s mega hit points increases by 10. Your ship must be fighter-sized to accept this upgrade. Jump Rift. When your ship makes a void jump, any ship within 500 feet of it is carried with it when it jumps.</p><p>Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Lifeform Scanner</strong></em>. You enhance your ship’s sensors to be able to detect living creatures. The ship’s engineer can spend 1 minute to scan a ship within 100 miles to determine the exact number of living humanoids onboard.</p><p>Your ship must have sensors to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Live Feed</strong></em>. Your communications system provides a live video feed or holographic image of both parties. The recipient can choose whether or not to mask their image from your feed. Both parties must have a live feed to use this upgrade.</p><p>Your ship must have communications to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Material Analyzer</strong></em>. Your sensors have been upgraded with a directional scanner that determines a target's composition. The ship’s engineer can spend 1 minute to scan a target within 1,000 miles, learning by percent which metals, minerals, and materials make up the target.</p><p>Your ship must have sensors to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Medical Station</strong></em>. A complete overhaul of your ship's sickbay has made it analogous to a small hospital. Your sickbay has twice as many (12) medical dice. Additionally, you can spend 1 minute and expend 3 medical dice to remove a level of exhaustion from yourself or another creature in the sickbay, or to end one of the following conditions afflicting you or another creature in the sickbay: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</p><p>Your ship must have a sickbay to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Overshield</strong></em>. An additional generator is added to supplement the shields, increasing your ship’s maximum shield points by 6.</p><p>Your ship must have a shield generator to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Panic Drive</strong></em>. Your ship’s Dark Matter engine has been heavily customized with a secondary arcane engine to pump energy into the core for faster, but more erratic charging times. Once the engineer has taken the Void Jump action to charge the Dark Matter engine, they can use their action on each of their subsequent turns to panic jump the Dark Matter drive, possibly jumping early. Roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, the ship jumps early.</p><p>Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Radio Array</strong></em>. Your ship can communicate with another ship out to a range of 10,000 miles, rather than 1,000 miles. If the receiving ship has communications but does not have this upgrade, it can receive messages, but not transmit replies.</p><p>Your ship must have communications to receive this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Reinforced Hull</strong></em>. Great alloyed bands are attached on the exterior of the hull, increasing your ship’s AC by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Repair Drones</strong></em>. A series of mechanized drones patrol the outer side of the hull, automatically sealing leaks and repairing structural damage. If your ship is below half its hit point maximum, it regains 1 mega hit point at the beginning of the initiative order.</p><p><em><strong>Targeting Optics</strong></em>. One installed ship weapon of your choice gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and its range increases by 500 feet. You can choose this upgrade more than once, applying it to a different weapon each time.</p><p><em><strong>Tri-Probe</strong></em>. Instead of holding only one drone, your probe bay instead holds three. Each of these probes can be controlled independently.</p><p>Your ship must have a probe to receive this upgrade.</p><p><em><strong>Smuggler’s Hold</strong></em>. Your ship has hidden compartments in its hold, perfect for smuggling. These compartments can hold up to 1,000 pounds (which don't count against your ship’s cargo capacity) in objects no larger than 6 feet in any dimension.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":825000,"name":"Example Ships","type":"text","_id":"77ieIR8u39v1k88T","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The followings ship statistics double as statistics for NPC ships and as blueprints for typical ships that the player characters might use.

Its flagship, The Prophet, is a vessel of terrifying might, and is said to have burned its mark into every elven ship it crossed during the days of the Night Crusade. Now, it slumbers peacefully with much of the Congregation in a large perimeter around the Sepulcher Star, awaiting another grand Crusade.</p><p>Avia-Ra ships demonstrate a meeting of traditional design, canny ingenuity, and startling ruthlessness. There is no better evidence of this than the scorchers borne by most ships in the Congregation: a powerful symbol of the Sun's might, and also a deceptively simple circumvention of elven shield technology.</p><h3>Pilgrim</h3><p><em>Avia-Ra fighter</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13<br /><strong>Mega Hit Points</strong> 35<br /><strong>Engines</strong> Impulse (3,500 feet): Maneuverability (180)<br /><strong>Systems</strong> Communications, life support, sensors<br /><strong>Crew</strong> Pilot<br /><strong>Cargo</strong> 500 lb.<br /><strong>Cost</strong> 1,000 gp<br /><strong>Challenge</strong> 1 (200 XP)</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Annealed Hull</strong></em>.

As such, gnomes can fly without hindrance into Dead Magic Zones and can penetrate deep into the uncharted territory beyond. The largest Dead Magic Zones even provide some measure of protection for the Gnomish Flotilla, the permanent armada of gnomish ships, and demonstrate the spite most gnomes hold for magic in general: even approaching the Flotilla from the wrong angle will strand an ordinary ship without power in the Black, a death sentence for those who are not promptly rescued.</p><p>The advances and complexities of gnomish ships are due to their growing mastery of a baffling art known as science. Guided by this philosophy, gnomish ships are apt to follow different naming conventions: blasters are more likely to be called lasers, sickbays are more likely to be called hospitals, and so on.</p><h3>Cog</h3><p><em>Gnomish fighter</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13<br /><strong>Mega Hit Points</strong> 44<br /><strong>Engines</strong> Impulse (3,000 feet): Maneuverability (180)<br /><strong>Systems</strong> Communications, life support (no artificial gravity), sensors<br /><strong>Crew</strong> Pilot, 1 passenger<br /><strong>Cargo</strong> 1,000 lb.<br /><strong>Cost</strong> 1,400 gp<br /><strong>Challenge</strong> 1 (200 XP)</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Mechanical Design</strong></em>.

In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.</p><p>More than just a ship, a Lakshayan battle frame is an extension of the pilot, and using one is a dance of tactical maneuvers and precision strikes.

Firstly, stomping around in a forty-foot tall battle frame, punching colossal space monsters, and crushing hovertanks underfoot is pure, unadulterated fun. Secondly, and perhaps just as importantly, battle frames are similar enough to normal combatants that they can almost forgo ship combat rules entirely and run combat as normal creatures, albeit on a mega scale.</p><p>In this sort of campaign, characters can utilize all of their class features, no matter how elaborate, through extensions and customizations to their frames. Wizards might have miniaturized arcane cannons, gadgeteers might be equipped with mega-sized versions of their gadgets, and paladins might carry weapons with a super\u0002hot plasma edge to deal radiant damage when they smite. Some versions of mecha campaigns might only grant class features to pilots while inside their frames, to signify that their weapons, armor, and abilities are only properties of their frames, rather than being equipment and skills they personally possess.</p><p>Frames use the HP, AC, and other statistics of their pilots. Furthermore, each player should be in command of a single frame, utterly unique in design. Most successful campaigns will also probably require the party to have a Shōgun or similar ship to transport their frames.</p><h3>Frame Upgrades</h3><table style=\"width:250px\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Upgrade</strong></td><td><strong>Cost</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Additional Arms</td><td>4,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Arm Barrier</td><td>2,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Combining</td><td>2,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Dragon’s Breath</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Dragon’s Jaw</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Frame Weapon</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Transforming</td><td>3,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Zeus Burst</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Most battle frames are extensively customized to match their user’s strengths and preferences. In addition to other ship upgrades, the following upgrades can be installed on any frame for the listed price. However, frames can only have two melee weapons installed at one time, and one upgrade with the “(Recharge 5–6)” restriction.</p><p><em><strong>Additional Arms</strong></em>. You’ve installed a tertiary pair of arms beneath your frame’s normal arms. These arms can hold weapons, manipulate objects, and perform actions as your frame’s normal arms can, but they don't grant additional actions. You have advantage on ability checks you make to grapple mega creatures or other frames with your frame. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can use the additional arms to make an attack with a mega-sized version of a weapon with the Light property.</p><p><em><strong>Arm Barrier</strong></em>. You install a directional shield generator into one of your frame's arms. You can activate or deactivate this shield, which has 8 shield points, as a bonus action. The shield covers only one of your sides, which you choose when you activate it. Unlike other shield generators, the arm barrier only regains shield points after the shield has been deactivated for one round.</p><p><em><strong>Combining</strong></em>. Due to an extensive set of modifications and upgrades, this ship can combine with other frames and transform into an ultima frame.</p><p><em><strong>Dragon’s Breath (Recharge 5–6)</strong></em>. You install a kiln of evocation energy within your frame’s chest, which can produce a great burst of flame, much like a dragon’s breath, in a 3,000-foot cone. Each mega creature and the pilot of each ship in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 mega fire damage, or half as much on a successful save.</p><p><em><strong>Dragon's Jaw</strong></em>. You install a pair of wicked mechanical jaws onto your mech, which can bite down with tons of force. You can use these jaws to make a bite attack with a range of 50 feet, dealing mega damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Frame Weapon</strong></em>. You replace your frame's melee weapon with a mega-sized version of any melee weapon of your choice. The ship weapon's statistics are identical to the normal melee weapon but deal mega damage and have a reach of 50 feet. A reach weapon has a range of 1,000 feet. Only a pilot who can proficiently use a normal version of this weapon can proficiently use the mega version.</p><p><em><strong>Transforming</strong></em>. You’ve rebuilt most of the critical infrastructure of your frame, allowing it to fully transform into a more traditional ship as an action. While transformed, your frame loses the Frame trait, its maneuverability decreases to 90 degrees, its flying speed increases to 4,500 feet, and it loses the use of its melee weapons. Some frames are modified to transform into land or sea-based vehicles, and gain a speed on land or water while transformed appropriate to their form.</p><p><em><strong>Zeus Burst (Recharge 5–6)</strong></em>. You have embedded a sparking, electromagnetic core in your frame’s chest, which you can activate as a bonus action, unleashing a flash of lightning bolts in every direction. Each mega creature and the pilot of each ship within a 1,000-foot radius sphere of your frame must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 lightning damage.</p><h2>Nautilid Ships</h2><p>Lonely nautilid whorl ships wander the galaxy, searching for a world that might not even exist. When their homeworld of Poseidon was destroyed, the only haven left to the nautilid race were their immense ships, filled with the rare aqueous solution in which they can thrive. Indeed, whereas other ships and life suits are designed to withhold a volume of air, nautilid ships and suits are pumped with water and a cocktail of minerals specific to their race. Visitors to nautilid ships, therefore, need to prepare as if going on a deep dive or a spacewalk before coming aboard.</p><p>The design of whorl ships, and the smaller pincer ships, are inspired by the long-dead undersea creatures of Poseidon; their hulls resemble great shells, and their landing gear, immense legs. True to their name, pincers are even armed with immense crab claws, capable of shredding smaller craft in a matter of minutes.</p><h3>Pincer</h3><p><em>Nautilid fighter</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 14<br /><strong>Mega Hit Points</strong> 40<br /><strong>Engines</strong> Impulse (3,500 feet): Maneuverability (180)<br /><strong>Systems</strong> Communications, life support (ship contains water instead of air), sensors<br /><strong>Crew</strong> Pilot, 2 passengers<br /><strong>Cargo</strong> 2,000 lb.<br /><strong>Cost</strong> 1,200 gp<br /><strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP)</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Armored Hull</strong></em>.

Industrial in the sense that they run on gasoline, coal, and other crude sources, orc ships spout smoke and sputter flame as they tear across the sky. These pragmatic design influences are matched with strictly aesthetic ones: an orcish rig can usually be found with attractive accessories and an eye-catching paint job.</p><p>Other goblinoids, including bugbears and goblins, also tend to tend to use general orc ship designs, but take far less care with the workmanship, leading to uneven hulls and barely-stable Dark Matter cores. These ships have garnered the moniker “scrap ships”, whereas true orc ships are called “rigs” or “rides”.</p><p>Regardless of the model, a small contingent of orc ships make a ready fighting force, as they are sensibly built and battle-tested in the Warzone.</p><h3>Orc-Rig</h3><p><em>Orcish fighter</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13<br /><strong>Mega Hit Points</strong> 28<br /><strong>Engines</strong> Impulse (3,000 feet): Maneuverability (180)<br /><strong>Systems</strong> Communications, life support, sensors<br /><strong>Crew</strong> Pilot, 3 passengers<br /><strong>Cargo</strong> 1,500 lb.<br /><strong>Cost</strong> 1,800 gp<br /><strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP)</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Industrial Design</strong></em>.

One gunner can make attacks with both of this ship's rip\u0002chains when they make an attack.</p><h2>Vect Ships</h2><p>No craft in existence works precisely like a vect ship. Utilitarian to the point of volatility, vect ships abandon all systems and features not strictly related to their operation, forgoing even life-support; after all, vect don't need to breathe, and the exposed arcane engines powering their ships provide just enough heat to keep the pilot from freezing to death. Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.</p><p>In the centuries following the Night Crusade and the liberation of vect in the galaxy, most vect ships have been decommissioned—their volatility proving to be too much of a liability for everyday use. But some militant splinter cells of vect, often separatists or religious zealots, can still be found employing the designs, which, though inherently unstable, are extremely formidable in combat.</p><h3>Drone</h3><p><em>Vect fighter</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13<br /><strong>Mega Hit Points</strong> 32<br /><strong>Engines</strong> Impulse (3,500 feet): Maneuverability (360) Systems Communications, sensors<br /><strong>Crew</strong> Pilot (vect only)<br /><strong>Cargo</strong> 500 lb.<br /><strong>Cost</strong> 800 gp<br /><strong>Challenge</strong> 1 (200 XP)</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Auto-Assault</strong></em>.

But within those shells is something even stranger: a living, organic interior.</p><p>Just as other wrothian technology, like collection vats and brains in a jar, is alive with a kind of bestial intelligence, so too are their ships. On the inside, the chitinous black exoskeletons give way to tough, crimson tissue that lines the walls and hallways. Structures of black chitin form biomechanical interfaces, devices, rooms, and hallways. A stygian ship can nearly pilot itself, but is driven by psionic impulse from wrothian primarchs, who reside near the ship's nervous center.</p><p>These ships are nourished by the same psionic energy that sustains the wroth themselves; they are integral to the wrothian lifecycle. Deep in the Black, the wroth inhabit their stygian ships, emerging only to raid planets for humanoids, harvesting them for their bio-matter and minds. These minds are processed into brains in a jar, whose psionic potential nourishes the ships and the wrothians themselves, perpetuating the cycle.</p><h3>Umbra</h3><p><em>Wrothian fighter</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 11<br /><strong>Mega Hit Points</strong> 15<br /><strong>Engines</strong> Impulse (3,500 feet): Maneuverability (180) Systems None Crew Unmanned<br /><strong>Cargo</strong> —<br /><strong>Cost</strong> —<br /><strong>Challenge</strong> 1/2 (100 XP)</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Organic Design</strong></em>.

Though an elven flying car might be made of sleek ironwood and a dwarven one would feature hard angles and a more spacious trunk, they're both more alike than they are different, and consequently share the same statistics.</p><p>Pragmatic but inefficient designs also belong in this category. The Battle Planetoid, for example, is an asteroid or small moon retrofitted with engines, life support, and a small Dark Matter engine. Though utterly impractical, goblins, kobolds, and other small races have utilized this design time and again.</p><p>The exception to this rule is a ship that literally belongs nowhere else: the Infinity is a legendary vessel, made by no race living today. Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps. It is an enigma; perhaps a relic of an ancient galactic empire, a visitor from another galaxy, or something even stranger.</p><h3>Flying Car</h3><p><em>Miscellaneous fighter</em></p><hr /><p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 10<br /><strong>Mega Hit Points</strong> 5<br /><strong>Engines</strong> Impulse (2,000 feet): Maneuverability (180)<br /><strong>Systems</strong> None<br /><strong>Crew</strong> Pilot, 3 passengers<br /><strong>Cargo</strong> 1,000 lb.<br /><strong>Cost</strong> 750 gp<br /><strong>Challenge</strong> 0 (0 XP)</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Open Air</strong></em>.

Without a Dark Matter engine, even the most advanced civilizations the 'verse over would not have crossed the vast Black separating worlds, but with one, a ship can skip from nebula to nebula on a whim.</p><h2>Void Jumps</h2><p>To cross the 'verse quickly, Dark Matter engines conduct their ships through the Void, an utterly incomprehensible dimension of singularity. The Void's hostile nature renders direct exposure to it untenable, and worse still, its strange radiation baffles navigational instruments. The safest means to perform a jump, therefore, is to lower thick protective shutters and jump nearly blind, with perhaps some assistance from powerful divination magic. Travel by void jump isn't perfect, but it is a necessity; the flow of people and goods across the 'verse is borne by regular use of Dark Matter engines, so resourceful pilots have found a few ways to heighten the accuracy of their jumps. There are three principle types of void jump using a Dark matter engine: a blind jump, without navigational aide of any sort, an assisted jump, which uses recent star charts or the astrogation spell as a guide, or a maw jump, which translocates the ship from one maw to another, always without error.</p><h3>Unassisted Jump</h3><p>An unassisted, or “Blind,” jump carries a significant risk. Often, it’s preferable to assured death, but one can never be too sure when they will jump into a star, an asteroid field, or into a dangerous orbit around a black hole. When making a blind jump, the ship's pilot chooses a destination within range of the ship’s jump distance and rolls on the Blind Jump table.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.rolltables.XH6KqHufKV8comza]{Blind Jump}</h3><table style=\"width:550px\"><thead><tr><td style=\"width:45px\"><strong>d100</strong></td><td><strong>Result</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01</td><td><p><strong>Disaster</strong>. Your ship emerges dangerously close to a star or black hole. Your ship loses half of its HP and all its systems are reduced to 0 HP and disabled. Your ship can’t perform a void jump until it is repaired with a DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check and 1 hour of work. If the ship can’t escape within an hour, it will be destroyed.</p><p> You are no closer to your destination.</p></td></tr><tr><td>02-03</td><td><p><strong>Void Encounter</strong>.

You are close enough to your target to reach it with 10 minutes of sublight travel.</p></td></tr><tr><td>81-00</td><td><p><strong>Perfect Jump</strong>. Your ship emerges from the void jump precisely where you intend to, often near a spaceport or in orbit around a planet.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Assisted Jump</h3><p>Canny spacers have worked for centuries to circumvent the obstacles presented by the Void's strange radiation, and have come up with a few ways of doing so.</p><p><em><strong>Using a Star Chart</strong></em>. Starfaring guilds have devised the means to integrate void jump data, gravitational scans, and planetary maps into <strong>Star Charts</strong>, downloadable data packages which ship computers can use to calculate rough jump trajectories. Though the ship still technically flies blind, it spends time before the jump simulating different jump results until it finds a generally safe course. This always takes one hour. Using a star chart for an assisted jump always places the ship near its intended target, close enough to reach the destination with 10 minutes of sublight travel.</p><p>Star charts become obsolete after about 18 months due to the shifting topology of space. A single chart allows transit to all the settled worlds in one territory, such as the Hegemony of Man or the Dwarven Conclave, but there are few, if any, charts to the Galactic Frontier. Moreover, a ship must be in good standing with a territory to gain access to its star charts, though large factions routinely circumvent this, offering charts to any ships in their employ. A cheaper alternative to purchasing a chart to an entire territory is to follow a specific route. Such routes are downloaded from existing flight data and calculated the same way as jumps using star charts, but only work from a specific starting point to a specific destination.</p><table style=\"width:200px\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Starchart</strong></td><td style=\"width:75px\"><strong>Cost</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Territorial Chart</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Route</td><td>50 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Using Astrogation</strong></em>. Resourceful mages have created a powerful divination spell to discern some semblance of direction when performing a void jump: astrogation. If the pilot of a ship performs a void jump while under the effect of this spell, they automatically make a perfect jump, arriving precisely where they intend to, often near a spaceport or in orbit around a planet.</p><p><em><strong>Using a Roach</strong></em>. Consuming a roach triggers a wave of euphoria and mind-expanding effects. Many pilots believe they can see the entire universe after consuming a roach, even though some see terrible visions of the Void. Consuming a roach grants a creature the benefits of the astrogation spell: a perfect jump. Roaches are generally cheaper than hiring an astrogator, but long-term roach use is dangerous and addictive. See Roach Addiction in Appendix E for more information.</p><h3>Maw Jump</h3><p>A maw jump carries no miss chance; any ship capable of performing a void jump can travel from one maw to the next without rolling on the Blind Jump table. Ships can only travel between adjacent maws in the network.</p><p>Whereas the maw stations in the center of the galaxy are extremely reliable, the outermost stations on the Galactic Frontier are a different matter entirely. Making a jump to a station on the outer ring is a one-way trip; you can’t jump back from the outer ring via a maw station. Additionally, maws on the outer ring have only intermittent connection between themselves: when you arrive at a new maw station on the outer ring, there is a 25% chance that an outgoing connection to an adjacent maw is disabled and won’t be restored for at least 7 days.</p><h2>Sublight Speeds</h2><p>When a pilot wants to travel within a star system, such as between a planet and its moon or between two planets, without initiating a void jump, they can achieve a cruising speed by accelerating in a straight line for 1 minute. While traveling at cruising speeds, the ship's speed increases to a maximum of 1/20th the speed of light, and it can make only gradual course corrections. The ship requires 1 minute to safely decelerate. A ship of Frigate size or larger takes 10 minutes to accelerate or decelerate.</p><h2>Planetary Scanning</h2><p>When exploring the Frontier worlds of the ‘verse, it's a good idea to learn more about a planet before entering its atmosphere. A planet might look harmless, but you might discover upon touching down that its atmosphere is poisonous or its “water” is actually liquid carbon dioxide. For this reason, most ships’ come equipped with a complex planetary scanning system, designed to inform their crew about a planet from a safe distance.</p><p>While you are in the Captain role of a ship with functional sensors, you can spend 1 hour to conduct an in\u0002depth scan of a planet within your sensors’ range to learn its basic geography and composition. If you spend 8 hours conducting a scan, you also learn any of the planet’s major environmental hazards, such as high gravity, a poisonous atmosphere, or volcanic activity. If you spend 24 hours conducting a planetary scan, you also learn whether the planet’s surface is inhabited, what general level of technology said inhabitants seem to possess (by detecting the presence of bronze, iron, steel, uranium, etc.), and its weather patterns over the next 24 hours.</p><p>Occasionally, one or more of a planet’s traits may prevent you from learning more about it. For example, a thick, cloudy atmosphere may prevent you from examining the planet’s geography or learning about any inhabitants, or a strong arcano-magnetic field might disrupt the scan entirely.</p><p>If your ship is equipped with a probe, you can plunge it into the planet’s atmosphere to get a closer look, potentially circumventing obstacles which prevent you from learning about the planet. Doing so allows you to gain a full 24-hour scan of the planet in 1 hour, but destroys the probe in the process.</p><p>Information gained from planetary scans are stored on your ship’s computer and can be later sold to interested parties, such as Astrogations Inc. Such payment is usually based on the planet’s tier of habitability, with superior planets (at lower tiers) paying best, and special bonuses for rare finds, such as Tier X worlds.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.U15p0RkRq1HMRCi9"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bjgntohdazs"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668119299711,"modifiedTime":1670444808367,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"mXHsuHaVpC1ixfez"}

The following tables outline your new proficiencies, as well as starting equipment and how best to approach a beginner starship.</p><h2>Skill Proficiencies</h2><p><em>Dark Matter</em> presents three new skills: Data, Piloting, and Technology. Characters of the following classes can choose to gain proficiency with these skills at 1st level:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Skill Proficiencies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alchemist</td><td>Data, Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Piloting</td></tr><tr><td>Bard</td><td>Data, Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Craftsman</td><td>Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Gunslinger</td><td>Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Monk</td><td>Piloting</td></tr><tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Data, Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Data, Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Warden</td><td>Piloting</td></tr><tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Data, Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Warmage</td><td>Data, Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Witch</td><td>Data, Piloting, Technology</td></tr><tr><td>Wizard</td><td>Data, Piloting, Technology</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Weapon Proficiencies</h2><p>Characters in most campaign worlds won't have proficiency with blasters and other high-tech weapons, but in Dark Matter, as well as other settings where characters are likely to be familiar with phasers and laser swords, characters gain the following proficiencies:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Weapon Proficiencies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alchemist</td><td>Simple blasters, simple melee weapons, arc baton</td></tr><tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Simple blasters, simple melee weapons, martial melee weapons, blitz cannon, magnus, REC gun, volcanic</td></tr><tr><td>Bard</td><td>Simple blasters, simple melee weapons, laser halfsword, laser sword</td></tr><tr><td>Channeler</td><td>Simple blasters, martial blasters, simple melee weapons, martial melee weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Simple blasters, simple melee weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Craftsman</td><td>Simple blasters, martial blasters, simple melee weapons, martial melee weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>Avia-ra sunstaff, skathári warclub</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Simple blasters, martial blasters, simple melee weapons, martial melee weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Gunslinger</td><td>Simple melee weapons, simple blasters, martial blasters</td></tr><tr><td>Monk</td><td>Simple blasters, simple melee weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Simple blasters, martial blasters, simple melee weapons, martial melee weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Simple blasters, martial blasters, simple melee weapons, martial melee weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Simple blasters, simple melee weapons, arc baton, laser halfsword, laser sword, thermal lance</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Antimatter dagger, phaser, psionic helm, repeater, swarm pistol</td></tr><tr><td>Warden</td><td>Simple blasters, simple melee weapons, martial melee weapons, blitz cannon, magnus, REC gun, volcanic</td></tr><tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Simple blasters, antimatter dagger, psionic helm</td></tr><tr><td>Warmage</td><td>Simple blasters, antimatter dagger, psionic helm</td></tr><tr><td>Witch</td><td>Simple blasters, antimatter dagger, photonic lash</td></tr><tr><td>Wizard</td><td>Simple blasters, antimatter dagger, photonic lash</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Starting Equipment</h2><p>The starting equipment from your class generally includes relevant weapons and armor, as well as an assortment of useful adventuring gear, collected in a pack. However, the equipment and packs that come with most classes might seem ill-suited to the demands of traveling through space or exploring an alien planet. Therefore, when you create your character, you can modify your starting equipment by following these guidelines:</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>If your class offers a simple or martial melee weapon, you can choose any weapon of the same type (simple or martial) from this book. If it specifically offers a dagger, you can choose to replace it only with an antimatter dagger.</p><p>If your class offers a specific simple ranged weapon and ammunition, such as the light crossbow with bolts or shortbow with arrows, you can instead choose any simple blaster you have proficiency with. If your class offers a specific martial ranged weapon with ammunition, such as a longbow and arrows, you can instead choose any martial blaster you have proficiency with.</p><h3>Equipment Packs</h3><p>You can replace any pack you get from your class with one of the following packs, or you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.JJgG6oB1PVYQeTQ7]{Ambassador's Pack} (500 gp).</strong></em> Includes a chest, a set of fine clothes, a comm set, a datapad, a flashlight, a holo\u0002sphere, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a life suit, a log keeper, 10 sheets of paper, a vial of perfume, and a wristwatch.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.dwHVc9IH2a7zeOPn]{Engineer's Pack} (325 gp).</strong></em> Includes a backpack, a comm set, a crowbar, a datapad, a flashlight, a hammer, an igniter, a life suit, dozens of assorted nuts and bolts, an omnitool, 10 rolls of vent tape, and a wristwatch.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.3fbGzJxdjJgtm7XZ]{Marine's Pack} (465 gp).</strong></em> Includes a backpack, a bed roll, binoculars, a comm set, 2 concussion grenades, a crowbar, a flashlight, an igniter, a life suit, 10 days of rations, a tactical vest, and a roll of vent tape. The pack also has 50 feet of rope strapped to the side of it.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.0dAe2MG6l1MLSQOR]{Researcher's Pack} (750 gp).</strong></em> Includes a backpack, binoculars, a comm set, a datapad, a flashlight, a holo\u0002sphere, a hypodermic needle, a life suit, a log keeper, an omnitool, a quadcorder, and a wristwatch.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.E0HlvdMIOMuotTLs]{Spacer's Pack} (628 gp).</strong></em> Includes a backpack, a bandolier, a comm set, a datapad, 2 flashlights, a holo\u0002sphere, an interface rig, 2 cans of krash, a life suit, a log keeper, an igniter, an omnitool, a quadcorder, 10 rolls of vent tape, and a wristwatch.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.I89iFGV89CVTxpOL]{Surveyor's Pack} (378 gp).</strong></em> Includes a backpack, a bandolier, a bed roll, binoculars, a comm set, a flashlight, a log keeper, an igniter, a life suit, a quadcorder, 10 days of rations, and a wristwatch. The pack also has 50 feet of rope strapped to the side of it.</p><h3>Starting Gold</h3><p>Because Dark Matter equipment can be more expensive than adventuring equipment in a low-tech campaign setting, with GM permission, you can double the number of gold pieces offered by your class and background.</p><h2>Bonus Fighting Styles</h2><p>Any character that gains a fighting style can choose from these, in addition to the fighting styles offered by their class:</p><h3>Akimbo</h3><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting with blasters, you do not take a penalty to the damage of the second attack.</p><h3>Crippling</h3><p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, to a minimum of 0, until the end of its next turn and it can’t take the Dash action until the end of its turn.</p><h3>Duelist</h3><p>While you are wielding a blaster in one hand and nothing in the other, if you make a ranged weapon attack and exceed the target's AC by 5 or more, you deal an additional die of weapon damage. You can only use this ability once per round.</p><h3>Shotgunner</h3><p>When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a blaster that has the Scatter property, you can reroll the lowest damage die, and you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is worse than the original.</p><h3>Titan Fighting</h3><p>You gain a +2 bonus to melee weapon attack rolls you make against Large or larger creatures.</p><h2>Picking a Starting Ship</h2><p>Nearly every band of explorers, spacers, and mercenaries needs a reliable ship to jetset around the universe. Plenty of smaller-scale games might focus on a single planet, or even a single space station, but for those which explore the breadth of the 'verse, a starting ship is unquestionably key. Sadly, even the most modest ships are unaffordable with the starting gold of any class, so it falls on the GM to decide which ship the party gets access to and how they acquire it.</p><p>As a guideline, parties of 1st to 4th level should get a Personal class ship, parties of 5th to 10th level should get a Transport class ship, and parties of 11th level or higher should get a Corvette class ship. Campaigns with an emphasis on ship combat can eschew these guidelines.</p><p>The GM can choose to bequeath the party a ship on behalf of their employers, either a wealthy benefactor or a faction. Doing this is a surefire way of grounding the party in the world and giving them a launching point for adventures, but also ties them to certain obligations.</p><p>Another option is for the GM to set a budget, say 10,000 gp, which the party can spend on any ship of Personal or Transport class, as well as their choice of upgrades. This approach is preferable if the party will spend a long time in their ship, whether in space combat or on a long voyage to the Frontier.</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":0,"name":"Shopping for a Ship","type":"text","_id":"12IFAKCqwRIh1DJC","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/char-opt-pg.webp\" /><blockquote><p>Oh no, it will be very difficult,” replied the vect. “There are rumors going around about warheads being smuggled through the Miaam-Osk Pathway, but they’re sure to be heavily guarded.”</p><p>Rami did some quick calculations. “I like the plan, but that’s five maw jumps away. Ain’t gonna be many people going that way on legitimate business either. I reckon we’re gonna need to grab a ship of our own while we’re here... You know how to hotwire a Dark Matter drive, right, Nano?”</p><p>After a brief period of rummaging, the gadgeteer produced a small object, bristling with probes, cables, and various other protrusions. “Certainly. If this thing still works.” Nano pressed a switch, reconnected a few loose plugs, thought for a moment, then ripped out a fat cylindrical component. Lights started blinking all over the device. “There we go.”</p><p>Giving the gadget a sidelong glance as he goes, Mekhet-Nu turns for the door. “Then let us head to the dock. I have some ideas about how we might procure a ship.”</p><p>“You’re not the only one,” said Rami, following him out. To Nano, she asked: “Hey, how far to the docks?”</p><p>“About 43 seconds, if you take the first door on the left,” came the reply, with robotic precision. “My personal shortcut. I do a lot of work up there, you know.”</p><p>The door led to a lift, which was precisely as fast as the vect said. However, Nano failed to mention the gut-wrenching g-forces as the lift rocketed to the docks above. Rami and Mekhet\u0002Nu stumbled out slowly, trying to maintain composure and avoid throwing up. Nano, oblivious, stalked forward into a cavernous hangar, in which dozens of ships were parked, no two the same.</p><p>“Lot of people around,” Nano whispered, “hope those ‘ideas’ were good ones.”</p><p>Recovering somewhat, Mekhet-Nu grunts, “Ah, yes, ideas. Can anyone see a ship that’s ready to fly, but with no one aboard?”</p><p>“Let me just quickly…” Nano skipped off to a nearby computer terminal and ran a few searches. “There’s a Herald over there that’s good to go. Or that Freelancer two bays down with the white livery?”</p><p>“The Freelancer.”</p><p>“I agree with Mek. It’ll hold more cargo. Alright, Nano, can you open the hangar doors from there?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Can you shut down the lights?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Do it. I’ll sneak over to the door control and start the opening sequence.”</p><p>Mekhet-Nu laid a hand on her shoulder. “Are you sure? There are vect in here, and dwarves that can see in the dark.”</p><p>“Please. I’m a grue. I could hide in a halfling’s shadow. I’m more worried about you two.”</p><p>“Don’t be. We nonbelievers have a few tricks up our sleeves as well.” With that, the avia-ra took hold of Nano’s arm and started across the hangar floor. “The people here know you, yes? Just act normal until we get near the ship. We have some time while Rami opens the doors.”</p><p>Thus they proceeded, with Nano offering apologies to anyone whose paths they crossed, assuring them that the lights would be fixed as soon as possible.</p><p>In the first bay was a sleek elven Interceptor, its pulse cannon half-disassembled, while an aristocratic elf—presumably the ship’s owner— remonstrated with a pair of technicians. The ship itself was beautiful, appearing to be made out of polished wood, carved into flowing, organic lines. Etched into the nose was an image of a tree, delicate leaves blowing back along the flank of the craft.</p><p>Nano and Mekhet-Nu continued past it, to the foot of the Freelancer’s umbilicus.</p><p>“The High Priests are always going on about the blessings of the Sun Above. But there are blessings to be found in the Void as well.” The monk knelt, pressed his palms together and touched a small screw lying on the ground. A deep, impenetrable blackness then poured from it, enveloping the surrounding area in magical darkness.</p><p>“Ooh, very good!” Said Nano. “No one will notice a darkness spell in the middle of blackout!”</p><p>Rami beamed at the others as she stepped onto the bridge. “I love it when a plan comes together.”</p></blockquote><hr /><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/char-opt-3faces.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p>The many worlds of <em>Dark Matter</em> are filled with characters great and small, from the gnomish mechanics that keep the Flotilla aloft, to righteous avia-ra pilgrims proselytizing on backwater worlds, to the intrepid human explorers mapping the far reaches of the galaxy.

these offerings merely tantalize new, science fiction twists on familiar characters.</p><hr /><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Class</strong></td><td><strong>Subclass</strong></td><td><strong>Level Available</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"><em>SRD Classes</em></td></tr><tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.cnPh8Q9z8osVM44B]{Path of the Dreadnought}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Wears a helmet to focus their unbridled rage</td></tr><tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.9e2rCfM8Qpx0t2As]{Path of the Wrecker}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Smashes constructs, machines, and enemies into bits</td></tr><tr><td>Bard</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.MWyyQtQKNZ7cCsnG]{College of the Spheres}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Composes cosmic music to inspire allies</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.vDwwiILyhLTtiQMd]{Circle of Configuration}</td><td>1st</td><td>Devoted to the avia-ra’s deity, the Sun Above</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.jTWD3sUbosUZxL1o]{Void Domain}</td><td>1st</td><td>Venerates the sinister Void and shapes voidstuff</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.vDwwiILyhLTtiQMd]{Circle of Configuration}</td><td>2nd</td><td>Wildshapes into a reconfigurable machine form</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.5beJuVyDdJ3OMdjy]{Circle of the Obelisk}</td><td>2nd</td><td>Raised to a higher evolutionary state by an enigmatic obelisk</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.1I9PmEqszK51uhEv]{Space Marine}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Battle-hardened marine clad in a suit of custom power armor</td></tr><tr><td>Monk</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.UfBu7gkgQ9AMM4gB]{Way of Gravity}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Uses ki to manipulate their own gravitational force</td></tr><tr><td>Paladin</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.vYEOBbGOLp6qcmUG]{Oath of the Sepulcher}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Sworn to defend the sovereignty of the maw network</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.GfLezfX2oUPuAS0J]{Deadeye Sniper}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Expert marksman at all ranges, trained in stealth</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.70EdM6PTly5sK5k8]{Reconnaissance Scout}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Leads landing parties and uses a recon drone to scout ahead</td></tr><tr><td>Rogue</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.k4LpyvfxSdLXUuTQ]{Infiltrator}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Expert in using an interface rig to steal data and gain access</td></tr><tr><td>Rogue</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.kWyI6pZhdNv8sc6E]{Jumper}</td><td>3rd</td><td>Teleportation expert, specializing in short-range blink teleports</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.Hnwx6OioGJalTq1U]{Nanite Host}</td><td>1st</td><td>Infested with a colony of advanced, symbiotic nanobots</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.classes.NSwxOkusp50kMEmn]{Radiation Freak}</td><td>1st</td><td>Afflicted by the warp;

This class can be found for <strong>free</strong> on <a href=\"https://magehandpress.com/category/content/mage-hand-press-classes/alchemist\">magehandpress.com</a></p></div><p>Research into the very nature of the elements has evolved from the erstwhile search for transmutation into gold to an involved magical and scientific field. The four elements can interact in deviously clever ways, especially when unusual states of matter such as plasma are utilized, such that many of the field's core principles could change with only a few major breakthroughs. In fact, one of these insights might be on the horizon, for gnomish alchemists are convinced of there being not four, but hundreds of elements, and are hellbent on proving it to the magical community at large.</p><h3>Field of Study</h3><p>All alchemists learn the basics of their science: the elements, chemical reactions, and alchemical formulae. Beyond that, alchemists pick up a specialty which they practice and research in depth. Some focus on the healing arts and some focus on destruction, whereas others focus on research or potion-brewing. Fields of study are as varied as the alchemists which research them and have applications equally as diverse.</p><h2>Ionizer</h2><p>Research into alchemical alternatives to devices such as blasters or personal shield emitters is practiced by very few alchemists, more out of scientific curiosity rather than true innovative spirit. A select few, however, become true masters in energy manipulation. These so-called ionizers can bend most forms of energy to their will using sophisticated alchemical reactions.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you select this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Technology skill and with two martial blasters of your choice.</p><h3>Formula: Plasma Bomb</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can craft plasma bombs. By replacing your bomb's explosive reagent with an ion-fluxer, you can change it into a plasma bomb. A plasma bomb deals radiant damage instead of fire damage. When you hit a creature with this bomb, an intense attractive force causes it to permanently stick to the creature, exploding at the end of the creature's turn. When this bomb explodes after sticking to a creature, it deals additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><h3>Heatsink</h3><p>By 6th level, you've learned an alchemical trick to channel excess heat away from a blaster, normalizing its temperature. Once per turn, you can use an action or a bonus action to supercool a blaster you touch. The next time this blaster would overheat within the next minute, it automatically cools down and stops being overheated. If you supercool a blaster that is overheated, it immediately stops being overheated. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Electromagnetic Shield</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you have discovered a way to deflect harmful projectiles by reverse engineering a plasma bomb. As a reaction when you would be hit by a ranged weapon attack that deals force, lightning, necrotic, or radiant damage, you can roll a d6. On a roll of 6, the attack misses you.</p><h3>Energetic Discharge</h3><p>At 18th level, you create a fist-sized “discharge device” that can absorb, store, and redirect small amounts of any energy that hits you. When you use your Electromagnetic Shield feature, regardless of your roll, your discharge device gains 1 charge, to a maximum of 10. Charges last for 24 hours. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend any number of stored charges and make a ranged attack roll against a target within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force or radiant damage (your choice) for each charge expended.</p><h1>Barbarians</h1><p>Barbarians are defined by the unbridled rage that dwells within them. Even as the aeons have marched forward and warfare has grown from swords and spears to interplanetary affairs of starships and warheads, barbarians have not budged; they are still an embodiment of primal, furious rage. Some barbarians focus their rage through circuitry and steel, becoming the brutal warlords of a new age, but others shun this new technology, smashing any that comes within arm’s reach.</p><h3>Primal Paths</h3><p>Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.</p><h2>Path of the Dreadnought</h2><p>The unstoppable soldiers of wartorn battlegrounds, it is the duty of the dreadnought to break enemy lines and raze entire cities. Each dreadnought wears an advanced helmet, a Berserker Helm, which, once donned, is never removed. Each helm is specially engineered to make the dreadnought fearless and to grant them complete control over their terrible rage. The helmet is the locus of their emotion, or lack thereof. To a dreadnought, reality is simple: there are friends and foes, good and evil, law and chaos. The rule above all: never remove your helm. Berserker Helm Beginning when you select this path at 3rd level, you are fitted with a helmet which regulates your emotion and focuses your anger. Assisted by your helmet, you can summon up rage at will, and end it just as swiftly. You are unable to rage if your helmet is removed. Instead of raging normally, you can rage for a number of rounds equal to your half your barbarian level (rounded down) + double your Constitution modifier. These rounds need not be consecutive. You can begin and end your rage as a bonus action. Your rage only ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it on your turn. After raging for this number of rounds, you must finish a short or long rest before raging again.</p><p>At 20th level, you can rage for any number of rounds.</p><h3>Fearless</h3><p>At 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. If you make this saving throw while you are raging, you can reroll one of the d20s once.</p><h3>Unstoppable Charge</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, when you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you have advantage on this attack roll.</p><h3>Focused Rage</h3><p>At 14th level, you can focus your rage into an unstoppable fury against a single target. When you enter a rage, you can choose 1 creature that you can see within 60 feet. Your attacks deal twice the normal amount of rage damage to this target.</p><h2>Path of the Wrecker</h2><p>Muscle breaks Steel; Rage defeats Machines; Strength beats Systems; such is the creed of the wrecker. True barbarians learn this creed quickly when set adrift in the so-called civilized world of blinking lights and metal walls. People have lost their way in this universe, trusting their lives to machines and algorithms instead of the reliability of their own might. Setting upon the Path of the Wrecker means tearing down the machines and buildings of the mechanized world and letting your bottomless rage guide you when the universe itself seems upside-down.</p><h3>Dismantle</h3><p>By 3rd level, ripping apart machines, piece by piece, comes second nature to you. While you're raging, you ignore the damage threshold of nonmagical objects. Additionally, you double the rage bonus damage you deal to constructs and living constructs.</p><h3>Percussive Maintenance</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you understand that smashing something usually makes it work better. You can attempt to hack a device that could usually be hacked, such as a door control panel or an arcane terminal, by breaking it. Make a Strength (Athletics) check in place of an Intelligence (Data) check. On a success, you perform one operation on the system of your choice as if you had full access, just as if you successfully hacked the system. The machine breaks immediately after this and can't be used afterwards without repair, whether or not you succeeded on the check.</p><h3>Disarm Foe</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“Oy! I said I disARMED ‘im. Geddit? Geddit? I don’t think you geddit.\"</p><p>— Vrok, orc barbarian</p></blockquote></div><p>By 10th level, you've become quite skilled in the time\u0002tested tactic of ripping off an enemy's limb and swinging it at them. You gain proficiency in improvised weapons. When you reduce a humanoid creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack, you can rip off one of its limbs. Alternatively, you can use your action to attempt to rip a limb off a Large or smaller construct or undead creature within 5 feet of you by making an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against it. A construct or undead that has more than half its hit points automatically succeeds on this check. If you successfully rip off a limb, you can immediately use it to make a melee attack as a bonus action. A creature missing a limb can't make attacks using a removed limb and has disadvantage on ability checks that involve using their limbs. You can only remove one limb from a creature.</p><p>A severed limb is an improvised melee weapon which deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If removed from a Large creature, it deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage instead.</p><h3>Crush, Smash, Bash</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, your strikes land with such ferocity that you tear armor and armor plating asunder. While raging, when you deal damage with a melee weapon attack to a construct or a creature wearing armor, you can cause the armor or construct to take a cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers, to a maximum penalty of −4 AC. A construct or suit of armor damaged by this ability can be repaired in 1 hour for 100 gp per point of AC penalty taken.</p><h1>Bards</h1><p>Bards are consummate performers and entertainers, and often find that their skills have unexpected and wide\u0002reaching applications across the 'verse. Any bard can play for the guests of a halfling hearthstation, but many bards can also find work as translators, ambassadors, salesmen, spies, and historians. Bards are experts at putting a smiling face on an enterprise and a skilled hand to its operation, which keeps their talents in demand no matter where they travel.</p><h3>Bardic College</h3><p>The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.</p><h2>College of the Spheres</h2><p>Since time immemorial, musicians and storytellers have looked to the heavens for inspiration, imagining them to be the souls of great heroes or the divine singers of some eternal ballad. Now that bards can travel among the celestial spheres for themselves, the true sound of the Universal Music has been found: not in the roaring of stars or the crashing of asteroids, but in the incredible diversity of peoples and cultures that permeates the galaxy. Bards who belong to the College of the Spheres seek to blend as many of these influences together as they can, creating stunning, multi-layered compositions that push both the player and the listener to the limits of possibility.</p><h3>Universal Music</h3><p>When you join this college at 3rd level, you begin to explore the relationship between music and mathematics, gaining a deep understanding of cutting-edge science. You have advantage on any Intelligence check relating to advanced mathematics, geometry, kinematics, acoustics, or ballistics.</p><h3>Astronomy Domine</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you begin to channel the majesty of the stars with your spellcasting. Whenever you deal damage with a bard spell, you can change the damage type to radiant damage. Additionally, you can increase the damage by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration, adding that die to the spell’s damage roll.</p><h3>Stellar Chorus</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your voice gains the backing of a distant chorus that echoes across the heavens. Whenever one of your Bardic Inspiration dice is rolled, you can roll it twice and take whichever result you prefer.</p><h3>Harmonic Convergence</h3><p>When you reach 14th level, you are so attuned to the rhythm of the cosmos that the skies shake when you sing. Once per turn, when a creature makes a saving throw against a spell you cast, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll.</p><h1>Channelers</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Channeler</h4><p>This subclass makes use of the Mage Hand Press Channeler class and its accompanying rules. This class can be found for <strong>free</strong> on <a href=\"https://magehandpress.com/category/content/mage-hand-press-classes/channeler\">magehandpress.com</a></p></div><p>Masters of sword and spell alike, channelers draw their power from the planes of the multiverse, focusing this energy like a lens to produce magical effects. Channelers have explored the breadth of the 'verse, along with the infinitely more expansive multiverse, in pursuit of their goals, which often include securing nuggets of arcane knowledge or lesser-known artifacts. Their networks of allies, called Planar Orders, extend across the 'verse and might prove invaluable to explorers and adventures lost among the stars, especially to those searching its recesses for similar objectives.</p><h3>Planar Order</h3><p>A channeler's first steps into the multiverse are daunting: the infinite planes of existence are treacherous and do not yield their secrets easily. To this end, channelers abroad in the multiverse rely on their planar orders for guidance, protection, and information. Even on their home planes, planar orders sometimes meet to discuss business or ensure that the plane is protected from outsiders with malicious intents.</p><h2>Order of Mawstone Psions</h2><p>The Order of Mawstone Psions believes that the 'verse is interwoven with innumerable, invisible tethers that tie it all together. Everything and everyone is connected in this grand network, whether or not they are aware of its influence. By attuning themselves to the maws, these channelers achieve an uncanny intuition and a perspective on their place in the 'verse. Their order seeks to keep the ‘verse in balance, while following the mysterious will of its tethers.</p><h3>Key Mawstone</h3><p>At 1st level, your planar key is a smooth stone (technically a bone fragment) taken from a maw, through which you feel an innate bond to the universe. While holding your mawstone, you can use the following psionic abilities:</p><p><em><strong>Empathy.</strong></em> You can use your action to probe the surface level of a creature's emotions. You must be able to see the creature and it must be within 30 feet and have an Intelligence of 3 or higher. You learn the creature's emotional state and, at the GM's discretion, one of the creature's Bonds.</p><p><em><strong>Kinesis.</strong></em> You can use your action to invisibly manipulate objects within 30 feet of you. You can move objects weighing less than 10 pounds, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can't use this ability to attack or activate magic items.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>At 1st level, you learn three cantrips of your choice from the following list: <em>cheat, chill touch, eye of anubis, eye of ra, force dart, hardlight needle, light, message, minor illusion, prestidigitation, ray of frost,</em> and <em>true strike</em>. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>At 8th level, you learn a fourth cantrip from this list.</p><h3>Bonus Focus</h3><p>At 7th level, you gain the following Planar Focus option:</p><p><em><strong>The 'Verse.</strong></em> You can feel the tethers of the universe propelling your movements and guiding your strikes. While you maintain this focus, your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. As normal, if you score a critical hit with a spell while Spell Channeling, you roll both the spell's and weapon's damage dice twice.</p><h3>Telekinetic</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can cast the spell telekinesis once without using arcana points, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. You can maintain focus on both this spell and a Planar Focus at one time.</p><h3>Grandmaster Psion</h3><p>By 15th level, you are a master psion, empowered by your connection to the tethers' mystical will. Whenever you score a critical hit, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level, which last for one hour, and you regain 2 expended arcana points.</p><h1>Clerics</h1><p>The gods of the 'verse are many and varied. Practically every inhabited world bears its own pantheon of unique deities, each of which are capable of bestowing their believers with true miracles—feats of divine magic. Therefore, faith is an important resource on the galactic stage, as many rival pantheons compete for adherents. Clerics in <em>Dark Matter</em> can worship the gods of any traditional pantheon, or they might pledge their lives to the Temple of the Chosen, the Church of the Sun Above, or even fringe beliefs which venerate the all-consuming Void.</p><h3>Divine Domains</h3><p>In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain. Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.</p><h2>Sun Above Domain</h2><p>Clerics which pledge their loyalty to this singular religion of the sun must relinquish all other pantheons and deities; the Sun Above accepts nothing less than total devotion. To the avia-ra, and numerous other ancient cultures, the sun is the ultimate force of creation and destruction, an entity that banishes the darkness of ignorance and exposes the world in stark contrasts: light and shadow, day and night, good and evil. The Sun Above demands that its devotees spread its message to the stars, such that all worship be focused to it.</p><p>Though there are many stars, there is but one Sun Above: The Sepulcher Star. To hear the avia-ra tell it, they have always worshiped this star, even before they discovered it at the center of the galaxy. Today, the star is a site of pilgrimage visited by all true believers, who gaze upon its magnificent rays from the windows of the Solar Citadel.</p><h4>Sun Above Domain Spells</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Cleric Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Mzh95utKDPIrjiH8]{detect evil and good}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8MICCMeOXT3aJUy9]{divine favor}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3Lo9boi7P2ro6QV4]{hold person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.bV3yun6MIuFj71Er]{moonbeam}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{daylight}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.avD5XUtkBPQQR97c]{fire shield}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6]{wall of fire}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JQyigMNPiDnGI18b]{geas}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Unarmored Defense</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, your faith in the Sun Above shields you from harm. While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p><h3>Emissary of the Sun</h3><p>Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with the avia-ra sunstaff, laser halfsword, laser sword, photonic lash, and thermal lance.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your Dexterity instead of Strength for your melee weapon attacks and damage rolls. This feature only applies to weapons you are proficient with that lack the Heavy property.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Mark of Judgment</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can present your holy symbol and use your Channel Divinity to brand a creature that you can see within 60 feet with an ancient mark, condemning them to receive the absolute judgment of the Sun Above. For 1 minute, the target can’t take the Hide action, as it is followed by an uncanny light. Additionally, you deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack.</p><h3>Apologist</h3><p>By 6th level, you have attained the much-coveted rank of Apologist within the faith, and are tasked with carrying the message of the Sun to all who will listen and banishing those who would obscure this message. Whenever you make a Charisma check, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the roll.</p><p>Additionally, you can bend non-believers before the Sun’s authority. When you roll initiative and aren't surprised, you can choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw, opposed by your spell save DC. On a failed save, that creature has a penalty equal to your Wisdom modifier to its AC and attack rolls for the first round of combat.</p><h3>Divine Strike</h3><p>Starting at 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h3>Solar Zenith</h3><p>At 17th level, you can feel the sun’s majesty at your fingertips and can summon it in immense waves. You learn the spell sunbeam, and it counts as a cleric spell for you. Sunbeam is always prepared for you, and doesn't count against your number of prepared spells.</p><p>Additionally, as an action on your turn, you can fill yourself with the luminous wrath of the Sun Above. You can cast <em>sunbeam</em> as an 8th level spell without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell in this way, you regain hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier at the start of each of your turns if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You can't lose your concentration on this casting of <em>sunbeam</em> as a result of taking damage. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Void Domain</h2><p>Conventional understanding places the Void outside the cosmology of the rest of the universe, exploitable if one wishes to hop between the stars, but dangerous and foreign otherwise. But priests of the Void Domain know better: the Void is the least tangible, but most integral, element of existence. If the universe is a great orchestra of musical instruments, each producing sounds that comprise beautiful music, the Void is the silence between those notes, which gives rhythm and shape to the whole. The Void also gives rise to the differences between the instruments and empowers their individual songs amongst the whole. And finally, the Void shall make itself the conductor, waving its baton for the final time and commanding all the instruments to stop.</p><p>Those who accept the Void might stare into its hideous lights for the briefest moments and come away unravaged by the warp, yet purified by the light. Void priests seek to share this gift by bringing others to stare into the Void.</p><h3>Bonus Cantrips</h3><p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the <em>voidlight</em> cantrip, which doesn't count against your total number of cantrips known.</p><h4>Void Domain Spells</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Cleric Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7e3QXF10hLNDEdr6]{false life}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7buEm5KhI5lP8m1z]{guiding bolt}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.zwGsAv6kmwzYGhh3]{blindness/deafness}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq]{darkness}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.UfHQhA54M4323gVO]{vampiric touch}, @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.spells.A7K2h2HX1tRPXyIr]{voidwind}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.A4RsPuSvB9wFtz1j]{dimension door}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.sTIkQK7KuQNOyY0C]{hallucinatory terrain}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.wXzkqpeFP8eWgJzK]{antilife shell}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.lnaGnxMzpYnbw1uU]{creation}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Darkvision</h3><p>At 1st level, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you already possess darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><p>Starting at 8th level, you can see through magical, as well as nonmagical, darkness.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Shape Void</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to bend the walls of the universe, creating a small pocket of black voidstuff in its absence, and shaping it as you see fit. Choose one of the following options:</p><p><em><strong>Barrier.</strong></em> You warp the Void pocket into an impassable obstruction, a 5-foot diameter sphere, at an empty space you choose within 30 feet. For the next minute, while you maintain concentration on this effect as a spell, nothing can penetrate or move through this space.</p><p><em><strong>Javelin.</strong></em> You stretch the voidstuff into a crackling spear of energy, which you hurl toward a creature you can see within 60 feet. Make a ranged spell attack roll against the target. On a hit, you deal force damage equal to your Wisdom modifier + 1d12 for each point of your proficiency bonus.</p><p><em><strong>Pocket.</strong></em> You curve the walls of the universe outward, forming an extradimensional space that is large on the inside and hidden from the outside. This space is invisible from the outside and can hold 500 pounds, not exceeding 64 cubic feet of volume. It is anchored to your holy symbol; touching it allows a creature to see the entryway into the space.</p><p>This extradimensional space lasts for 1 hour. After that time, the space dissipates, and its contents spill forth.</p><h3>Void Step</h3><p>At 6th level, you can use your bonus action to step briefly into the Void, teleporting to an unoccupied location you can see within 20 feet. You can use this ability 3 times and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Potent Spellcasting</h3><p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p><h3>Oblivion</h3><p>By 17th level, you can use your action to open a rift in space and time into the Void around a creature or object of your choosing within 120 feet. A creature makes a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling into the rift. On a successful save, the creature avoids falling into the rift, but sees a glimpse of the Void and takes 2d8 radiant damage and 2d8 psychic damage. On a failed save, the creature is banished to the Void for 1d4 rounds, taking 2d8 radiant damage and 2d8 psychic damage at the beginning of each of its turns there. At the end of your following turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. Objects larger than 20 feet in any dimension and Huge and larger creatures can't fall into the rift.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before using it again.</p><h1>Craftsmen</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Craftsmen</h4><p>This subclass makes use of the Mage Hand Press Craftsmen class and its accompanying rules. This class can be found for <strong>free</strong> on <a href=\"https://magehandpress.com/category/content/mage-hand-press-classes/craftsmen\">magehandpress.com</a></p></div><p>The builders of fleets and founders of cities, craftsmen throughout the 'verse are highly sought out for their technical expertise and mechanical know-how. Nearly every large ship in the verse counts at least one craftsman among their number, and likely many more. The proliferation of new technology, both the magical, like blasters and Dark Matter engines, and the nonmagical variety, like the great gnomish ships, has led to a swathe of new discoveries and innovations made by notable craftsman. No longer are craftsmen merely blacksmiths and leatherworkers—they are roboticists, inventors, and engineers.</p><h3>Artisans’ Guild</h3><p>All master craftsmen individually learn the basics of smithing, leatherworking, woodworking, and other necessary disciplines on the path to mastery, either on their own or under tutelage of another master artisan. However, as they hone their skills, they invariably find themselves drawn to gatherings of other like-minded craftsmen. These groups, formalized as Guilds, provide a means for craftsmen to compare notes and schematics, acquire resources, and provide a means for craftsmen to ply their trade.</p><h2>Scrappers’ Guild</h2><p>Most craftsmen do their best work in precisely arranged workshops, with exact components, plenty of tools and space, and all the best materials. You’ve learned to be far more pragmatic and flexible with your choices for tools, materials, and workspace, allowing you to forge deadly gear out of little more than a box of scraps and a roll of vent tape.</p><h3>Makeshift Brawler</h3><p>Starting when you choose this guild at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with improvised weapons.</p><h3>Scrap Smithing</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“Scrap Bought HERE!”</p><p>— Sign outside Z+¥ Fabrication Ltd., Maw Station 015</p></blockquote></div><p>At 3rd level, you learn how to craft magnificent gear under less than ideal conditions and with less than ideal materials. You can craft scrap weapons, armor, and shields, which function identically to normal items, with the following exceptions:</p><ul><li><p>Scrap items cost no gold to produce, have half the normal crafting time, and can be made without any available tools.</p></li><li><p>Scrap items break after 24 hours.</p></li><li><p>You can make only one scrap masterwork item each day and can apply masterwork properties to this item at no cost.</p></li><li><p>Scrap items fall apart more easily. When you attack with a scrap weapon and roll a 1 on the d20, the weapon breaks and is no longer functional. Likewise, if you suffer the effects of a critical hit while wearing scrap armor or holding a scrap shield, roll a Dexterity saving throw for each piece of gear, with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage dealt, whichever is higher; on a failure, that armor or shield breaks and is no longer considered functional.</p></li></ul><h3>Quality Junk</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you find treasure where others see only trash. When you use make a Persuasion skill check in an attempt to buy or sell scrap or salvage, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Charisma modifier, and you add double your proficiency bonus to the check.</p><p>Additionally, you can cobble together tools and other equipment much more efficiently out of scrap. You now regain expended uses of your Tool Belt ability following a short or long rest.</p><h3>Scrapper's \"Improvement\"</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes to fortify a scrap weapon, or up to 6 scrap weapons following a short or long rest, each of which gains the following property:</p><p><em><strong>Unstable.</strong></em> This weapon deals an additional die of damage. On a hit, this weapon breaks and can't be repaired.</p><h3>Impromptu Repair</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you learn to make surprisingly effective repairs using scrap or junk. So long as you have a suitable amount of raw material (metal, wood, stone, etc.) and a bonding agent (nails, rivets, sovereign glue, copious amounts of vent tape, etc.), you can use your action to repair a nonmagical object or construct. A repaired object is restored to full functionality and also regains hit points equal to your craftsman level + your Intelligence modifier.</p><p>A destroyed or dead construct can be restored to functionality by using this ability, so long as no more than 1 minute has passed since the construct was destroyed.</p><p>You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all uses of this ability when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Master Scrapper</h3><p>At 18th level, you reach the peak of your craft. You learn the following masterwork property:</p><h4>Quick Configuration Socket</h4><p><em>Legendary property</em> <br /><strong>Components</strong> Masterwork weapon or armor When you apply this property to an item, select any other masterwork property of Master level or lower that the item does not already have. The item gains that property as a bonus property, even if it already had another property of the same level. You can use your action to replace this bonus property with another property of Master level or lower that the item does not already have. The item must always meet the prerequisites for its bonus property.</p><h1>Druids</h1><p>Strange, alien worlds are watched over by strange, alien druids. A druid’s magic is an embodiment of the natural world; however, in the vastness of space, \"natural\" usually means something completely unrecognizable to one’s home planet. Some worlds are dominated by exotic megaflora, whereas others have hardly any vegetable life at all. Alien animals come in innumerable forms, ranging from exoskeletal monsters of claws and teeth, to unusual crossbreeds between animal, fungus, and plant.</p><p>Yet more druids align themselves with artificial environments, becoming one with machines, circuits, and steel. These druids cast off the old conventions of naturalism and embrace the new technology of the ‘verse as a way to push life forward. What is life, after all, if not adaptable?</p><h3>Druid Circles</h3><p>Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p><h2>Circle of Configuration</h2><p>Some life is made of wire and steel, rather than flesh and bone. Druids who find credence in this notion join the Circle of Configuration and shun all ties to nature, aligning themselves instead with constructs and machines. Some do this because construct forms offer superior strength and adaptability compared to that of beasts. Others, however, believe that constructs represent a higher form of life, for constructs are ageless, designed with a clear intent, and are made to be free of hunger, thirst, and disease.</p><h3>Machine Code</h3><p>Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to speak the native code-language of machines. You can use this language to interact with arcane terminals and ship computers from range and to communicate with constructs, even if you don't share a language.</p><h3>Construct Form</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Construct Form</h4><p><em>Medium construct, neutral</em></p><hr /><ul><li><strong>Armor Class </strong>15 (natural armor)</li><li><strong>Hit Points</strong> 25 (15 + 5 x your druid level)</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.</li></ul><hr /><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>STR</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>DEX</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>CON</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>INT</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>WIS</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>CHA</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">16 (+3)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">16 (+3)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">14 (+2)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">6 (-2)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10 (+0)</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">8 (-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><p><strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, poisoned</p></li><li><p><strong>Senses</strong> passive Perception 10</p></li><li><p><strong>Languages</strong> —</p></li><li><p><strong>Challenge</strong> —</p><hr /></li><li><strong>Constructed Nature.</strong> You don't require air, food, drink or sleep.</li></ul><h4>Actions</h4><ul><li><em><strong>Photon Cannon.</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: </em>Your spell attack bonus to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. <em>Hit: </em>9 (2d8) radiant damage.</li></ul></div><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than an action. However, you lose the ability to assume the shape of a beast. Instead, you can use it to take a Construct Form. While in your Construct Form, you can use your bonus action to switch into a Configuration or to switch your current Configuration into another one. You have the following Configuration options:</p><p><em><strong>Juggernaut Configuration.</strong></em> Your Armor Class increases by 2. Whenever you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can subtract 2 from the damage taken. Additionally, your Photon Cannon is replaced by the following:</p><div class=\"item-indent\"><p><em><strong>Repulsor Gauntlet.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> Your spell attack bonus to hit, one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d10 + 3) force damage.</p></div><p><em><strong>Mobile Configuration.</strong></em> Your speed increases to 40 feet and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage. Additionally, while in this configuration, you have a 40-foot climbing speed and a 40-foot swimming speed. Additionally, at 8th level, you gain a 40-foot flying speed.</p><p><em><strong>Turret Configuration.</strong></em> Your movement speed becomes 0 while in this configuration. Additionally, when you use the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. Lastly, your Photon Cannon is replaced by the following:</p><div class=\"item-indent\"><p><em><strong>Photon Turret.</strong></em> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> Your spell attack bonus to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d10) radiant damage.</p></div><p>Additionally, starting at 6th level, while transformed in any Configuration, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h3>Speaker of Steel</h3><p>At 6th level, your empathy for constructs allows you to persuade their programming to your side. As a result, constructs can be charmed by you, even if they would otherwise be immune to being charmed. Additionally, if you cast the animal friendship spell, you can target a construct with the spell.</p><h3>Stalker Configuration</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you gain a Configuration optimized for stealth and subterfuge. As a bonus action, you can activate a cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, or cast a spell. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again on the following round. Additionally, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in this form and you gain the following action, in addition to your Photon Cannon:</p><div class=\"item-indent\"><p><em><strong>Antimatter Dagger.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> Your spell attack bonus to hit, one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d4 + 3) necrotic damage. Once per turn, you deal an extra 14 (4d6) damage if you have advantage on the attack roll, or if the target is within 5 feet of one of your allies that isn't incapacitated and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p></div><h3>Mecha Transformation</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to switch to an empowered version of your Juggernaut Configuration: a towering Mecha Configuration. While in this form, you have all the benefits of being in your Juggernaut Configuration, except you retain your photon cannon attack option and you subtract 4 from all damage you take, instead of 2. In addition, you become Large size, have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and can use your bonus action to make two melee weapon additional attacks when you take the Attack action.</p><p>You can remain in this configuration for up to 10 minutes. Once you enter this configuration, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Circle of the Obelisk</h2><p>The Circle of the Obelisk seeks to evolve lower lifeforms by channeling the mysterious power of an artifact known as the Obelisk. Black like the ichor between stars, this strange, rectangular prism has magically appeared throughout the cosmos, landing on primitive worlds and imbuing their inhabitants with the spark of knowledge. Druids of this circle believe that the Obelisk is responsible for all true evolution, and directly shaped all intelligent life in the universe; yet, very little is known about it. These druids seek to find the Obelisk's current location, unravel its mysteries, and raise themselves to a higher evolutionary state.</p><h3>Evolutionary</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you have a pool of 4 Evolution Dice, which are d4s, that you can use to raise yourself and your allies to greater power. As a bonus action on your turn, you can choose a willing creature you can see within 60 feet, spend 1 Evolution Die, and roll it. You increase one of that creature's ability scores of your choice by the amount rolled, to a maximum of 20, for 1 minute. A creature can have only 1 ability score increased by this ability at a time. You regain all expended Evolution Dice when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Transient Awakening</h3><p>At 6th level, you can bestow limited sentience on a lower form of life. You can cast the spell <em>speak with animals</em> or <em>speak with plants</em> without using a spell slot.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Superior Health</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, your biology is impeccable; immune to the ravages of lesser beasts. You gain immunity to one of the following conditions of your choice: blinded, deafened, or poisoned. You can change this selection when you take a long rest.</p><h3>High Evolutionary</h3><p>By 14th level, you have reached the pinnacle of your form. Each of your ability scores increase by 2, to a maximum of 20.</p><h1>Fighters</h1><p>When battles need fought and people need killed, fighters step up to the plate. Though their methods may vary wildly from terrestrial warriors, the mercenaries and knights of the 'verse are no less brave and mighty.</p><p>Finding fighters in the 'verse is easy: just search through the biggest groups of people for the toughest among them. From the power-armored warriors of Lakshay, who pilot battle frames to hold back the Warhorde, to the Coalition’s vast companies of space marines, fighting men the galaxy over have numerous options for employment, adventure, and tests of might.</p><h3>Martial Archetype</h3><p>Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.</p><h2>Space Marine</h2><p>Grunts, warhounds, mudstompers; they go by many names, but every great armada in the ‘verse is supported whole-cloth by its men and women on the ground. Among those brave soldiers, only a scarce few have the incredible strength, tenacity, and raw guts to join the ranks of the elite space marines. These super soldiers are bolstered by an arsenal of weapons and a suit of powerful and adaptable armor, called an impulse frame, which grants them every advantage possible over their opponents.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Piloting skill.</p><h3>Impulse Frame</h3><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch04-impulse-frame.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p>When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain access to the space marine’s most valuable piece of gear: a suit of magically-powered armor known as an impulse frame. An impulse frame is a suit of environmentally\u0002sealed heavy armor made of exotic alloys. While wearing your impulse frame, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Composite Plating.</strong></em> Your AC is 16, if it was not already higher.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Impulse Pack.</strong></em> Your suit has an integrated jet booster, allowing you a limited form of flight. You can use your bonus action to take off, granting you a flight speed equal to the remainder of your movement until the end of your turn. You must begin and end your movement on the ground, otherwise you fall.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Life Support Systems.</strong></em> Your impulse frame counts as a life suit.</p></li></ul><p>Your impulse frame is a magic item which is permanently attuned to you and does not count against your total number of attuned magic items. You can integrate a different suit of armor into your impulse frame by spending 100 gp worth of materials and 24 hours of construction time. Doing so confers the armor’s AC and magical properties (if any) to your frame. You can integrate only one suit into your frame at a time.</p><p>If your impulse frame is destroyed, it can be rebuilt with 10 days of work and 1,000 gp in materials.</p><h3>Bug Hunter</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you gain proficiency in the Perception and Survival skills if you did not have them before, and gain advantage on checks using those skills when tracking or spotting aberrations or monstrosities.</p><h3>Squad Leader</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you gain an upgrade to your impulse frame. Choose one of the following:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Heavy Frame.</strong></em> Your suit is reinforced with adamantine-composite metal. While wearing your impulse frame, your AC is 19, if it was not already higher. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while wearing it.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Marauder Frame.</strong></em> When you take off in your frame in combat, you can double your flight speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this ability, you can't fly using your frame until you move 0 feet on one of your turns. Additionally, opportunity attacks made against you while you are flying have disadvantage.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Skirmish Frame.</strong></em> Once per turn, you can deal extra damage to a creature you hit with a melee weapon attack. This damage equals 1d4 for every 10 feet you have moved on your turn, up to a maximum of 6d4.</p></li></ul><h3>Expert Marksman</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, when you make an attack with a blaster, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><h3>Mobile Commander</h3><p>At 18th level, you gain an upgrade to your impulse frame. Choose from one of the following:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Dragon Frame.</strong></em> You embed elemental manipulation technology into your suit. Choose a damage type from: acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage. While wearing your impulse frame, you have resistance to that damage type, and your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage of that type.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Overshield.</strong></em> Your suit gains a regenerating field of ablative force. While wearing your impulse frame, you have a pool of 30 temporary hit points. As long as you haven't taken damage for 5 rounds (30 seconds), you regain 5 temporary hit points to this pool at the start of each of your turns.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Wraith Frame.</strong></em> You can use your frame to cast the spell invisibility without using a spell slot. If you end this spell early by attacking a creature, that attack deals an additional 4d6 damage.</p></li></ul><h1>Gunslingers</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Gunslinger</h4><p>This subclass makes use of the Mage Hand Press Gunslinger class and its accompanying rules. This class can be found for <strong>free</strong> on <a href=\"https://magehandpress.com/category/content/mage-hand-press-classes/gunslinger\">magehandpress.com</a></p><hr /><p>“You know the best feeling in the ‘verse? It's when you’re at one of those Frontier bars—the kind without real doors—and some dumb kid challenges you to a duel. Then you put a clean shot past their ear before they even draw and watch 'em wet their pants.” “What?” “Alright, yeah, TropiKrash is better than that, but mine’s a close second.”</p><p>— Vidarr Syko, gunslinger and mercenary</p></div><p>When most everyone in the 'verse carries a blaster, it can be hard to distinguish the true gunslingers from the pretenders. Real gunslingers draw first, aim true, and know where their shots will land before they pull the trigger; most of them even look good while doing it. They don't rely on tricks or allies to win the day; they only need a reliable blaster and their own grit. Bottom line: you don't want to be staring at the business end of a gunslinger's blaster; you probably won't see much after.</p><h3>Gunslinger’s Creed</h3><p>Gunslingers have many features in common, but each of them walks their own path and follows their own code. This code, which gunslingers call a creed, embodies their core beliefs and informs their unique combat style.</p><h2>Space Cowboy</h2><p>Nothing matters to you more than freedom. With a blaster on your hip and the wide-open sky to explore, you no longer have to answer to any man. Conversely, the horrible dangers of the final frontier tend to draw gamblers and risk-takers, be they unscrupulous smugglers, bloodthirsty bounty hunters, or big damn heroes.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you adopt this creed at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Piloting skill.</p><h3>Hot Shot</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action on your turn with a blaster that doesn't have the Overheat property, you can use your bonus action to overcharge it. Whenever you hit a creature with an attack from this blaster during the Attack action, you can deal an additional die of damage to that creature. Afterward, however, your weapon is overheated and you can't use this feature again until the end of your next turn. An overheated weapon can't be fired again until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Gun with a Name</h3><p>At 7th level, you can customize your blaster to better suit the rugged lifestyle of a frontiersman. If you spend a short rest working on a blaster, you can modify it such that its normal and long ranges are doubled, it functions normally in adverse weather conditions, it can be fired normally underwater, and it can be used as a melee weapon with the statistics of a mace. You can only have one blaster modified in this way at any given time, and only you are able to use this weapon proficiently.</p><h3>Final Frontier</h3><p>By 10th level, the strange fighting styles of all manner of aliens no longer surprise you. You have advantage on saving throws against effects caused by aberrations, monstrosities, or oozes. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks you make to interact with aberrations.</p><h3>Zero-G Gunfighter</h3><p>When you reach 14th level, you master the art of fighting in deep space, fitting jet thrusters to your gear in order to gain extra maneuverability. You gain a jetpack magic item, which you can use for an unlimited amount of time each day while you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor. Furthermore, you are always considered to benefit from half cover while airborne or in an area of zero gravity.</p><h1>Monks</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Deflect Missiles</h4><p>The monk feature Deflect Missiles assumes that all ranged weapons use a missle of some variety. By extension, in <em>Dark Matter</em>, monks can deflect and redirect ranged attacks from blasters as if they were missiles.</p></div><p>Balance is key. A balanced body yields health, strength, and precision; a balanced mind grants acuity and inner peace. Monk are those who embrace balance as a practice and lifestyle, whether or not they choose to align themselves with a monastery and monastic order.</p><p>Though there are innumerable monasteries scattered throughout the 'verse, both on established worlds and on secluded asteroids far from them, monks can eschew traditional training and instead take guidance from other avenues. Some monks learn to fight on the streets of elven megacities, adopting balance and focusing their ki as a means of survival. Others learn to manipulate their ki from seclusion on long interstellar voyages; on such journeys, there is little occupation apart from introspection. And some monks learn martial arts from military organizations, such as the Lakshay defense force, and carry their skills forward to find a higher purpose. No matter how a monk learns to fight and manipulate their ki, they all achieve profound spiritual balance.</p><h3>Monastic Tradition</h3><p>A handful of monastic traditions are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the many traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.</p><h2>Way of Gravity</h2><p>Monks that have spent ample time in artificial gravity can feel the difference in their ki; natural gravity is substantial and wholesome, like an embrace from a great planet itself, whereas artificial gravity hums with a flimsy electrical artifice. With practice, these monks learn to manipulate their own gravity using their ki, throwing their center of mass about in defiance of physical conventions and tweaking gravitational fields around them.</p><h3>Subjective Gravity</h3><p>Starting when you choose this monastic tradition at 3rd level, you can choose your own center of gravity. On your turn, you can use half your movement to choose a solid surface (such as a wall or ceiling) within 30 feet of you to act as the ground for your subjective gravity. You are pulled down to this surface, as if by gravity. Your subjective gravity follows this surface along any smooth contours, but stops at any corners that turn 90 degrees or more. Only you and objects you wear or carry are influenced by your subjective gravity.</p><h3>Negate Mass</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 2 ki points to cast the spell <em>levitate</em>.</p><h3>Distortion Field</h3><p>Starting at 11th level, you can use your bonus action and spend 1 ki point to create an invisible 10-foot diameter sphere of gravitational distortion, centered on a point you can see within 60 feet. This distortion lasts for 1 minute. If a creature enters this space, its movement stops. At the beginning of each of its turns, the creature can use half its movement and make a Strength saving throw to escape the distortion field, moving to an adjacent unoccupied space of its choice on a success. On a failed save, the creature can't move. Any projectile that passes through your distortion field stops instantly in midair.</p><h3>Singularity Strike</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, your attacks carry massive fields in their wake. When you hit a creature with two or more unarmed strikes on your turn, you form a gravitational field around it. Until the beginning of your next turn, the creature can’t willingly move unless it first uses the Disengage action and spends half its movement to escape this field.</p><h1>Paladins</h1><p>A sacred oath is binding, no matter how far a paladin travels. Even a million light years from home, on the frontier of an alien world, their oaths still propel them forward and guide their hands. Such is the strength of a paladin's devotion.</p><p>Clad in gleaming power armor and wielding blinding laser swords, paladins are known to uphold justice throughout the 'verse. It is no accident, therefore, that a knightly order of paladins, the Order of the Sepulcher, watches over the maws and the Solar Citadel, ensuring that peace remains. Only the rigorous tenets of a paladin's vows could be trusted with something of such magnitude; were it any other group watching over these places, the 'verse likely would have descended into another great war, perhaps a second Night Crusade, centuries ago.</p><p>Apart from their orders, lone paladins pursue their righteous quests across the galaxy, often falling in line with other, less holy adventurers. Among these crews, paladins are differentiated by their unwavering honor and loyalty, as well as their penchant for protecting the innocent and slaying the wicked.</p><h3>Sacred Oath</h3><p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p><h2>Oath of the Sepulcher</h2><p>The Order of the Sepulcher Knights was founded to bring stability to the galaxy, to protect the maws from outside control, and to maintain balance between light and dark. Acting as a law-enforcing authority throughout the galaxy, the knights make their presence known most often around maw stations and on the Solar Citadel, their base of operations. A paladin that swears the Oath of the Sepulcher gains profound responsibility and a divine connection to all living things, a gift the knights believe comes from Old Un himself.</p><h3>Tenets of the Sepulcher</h3><p>The Order of the Sepulcher dates back to the Night Crusade’s conclusion, and its core vows are designed to prevent such a tragedy from ever again enveloping the galaxy:</p><p><em><strong>Balance Light and Dark.</strong></em> The Sepulcher itself is a speck of darkness within the blazing light of its star. In turn, the Void is a well of hideous light where one expects only darkness.

For the next minute, this weapon deals force damage or radiant damage (your choice) and has a bonus on damage rolls equal to your proficiency bonus. If the weapon isn't already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. The weapon also emits a bright blue light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that.</p><p>Additionally, when you attack with this weapon, you can swing it in the air to project a blast of energy. This is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30/120 feet and deals force damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier on a hit.</p><p>This effect ends early if the weapon leaves your hand, you fall unconscious, or you choose to end it on your turn (no action required).</p><p><em><strong>Longarm.</strong></em> You can use your bonus action to ensure that no one escapes the reach of justice. For the next minute, you can use your Divine Smite feature when you hit with a ranged weapon attack, in addition to melee weapon attacks. Additionally, your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover and count as magical for purposes of overcoming damage resistance and immunity.</p><h3>Aura of Atmosphere</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you are always under the effects of the spell zone of atmosphere. Additionally, if you are in an area of zero gravity, you have a flight speed equal to your movement speed. When you move in such an area, each friendly creature within 10 feet of you can use its reaction to move with you to remain within this aura.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Universal Shift</h3><p>Beginning at 15th level, you can cast the spell plane shift, targeting only yourself, without using a spell slot or spell components, or you can teleport to the nearest Maw station, appearing somewhere on its surface.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Galactic Knight</h3><p>When you reach 20th level, you learn to tap into the very heart of the stars, drawing on their immense power to fuel your fight for justice. As an action, you can choose one of the two following options:</p><p><em><strong>Solar Knight.</strong></em> For 1 hour, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet and the benefits of the Gamma Blade Channel Divinity. Additionally, when you or an ally within 30 feet of you takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to halve the damage taken. Galactic Knight. If you activate this ability in open space, outside the confines of an atmosphere or gravitational field, you can choose to pull energy from the galaxy itself and transform into a Galactic Knight. For 1 minute, you surround yourself in a massive, humanoid\u0002shaped field of cosmic energy, growing to 100 times your normal size. If you are Medium-sized, for example, you will grow to occupy a 500-by-500-foot square. For the duration, you gain a flight speed of 6,000 feet, your attacks deal mega damage, and your hit points are converted to mega hit points. Once you use this ability with either option, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h1>Rangers</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Ranger Variants</h4><p>These archetypes make use of the SRD Ranger class, but other variants might apply a special 5th level feature to this archetype. If you wish to use one of these archetypes with another version of the ranger class, add the Extra Attack feature at 5th level.</p></div><p>Wanderlust is in a ranger's blood. These master survivalists can set foot on just about any world and scrounge up enough food and water to survive there, but that's never enough; they need to keep exploring and seeing new horizons everywhere. In the 'verse, rangers feel most at home on the Galactic Frontier, planet-hopping between unseen worlds, far from the boundaries of squabbling galactic empires. Any sane adventuring party traveling that far from the galactic core counts a ranger among their number, for only an expert ranger can brave the perils of those undiscovered worlds and live to tell the tale.</p><h3>Ranger Archetype</h3><p>The ideal of the ranger has many expressions, from the nimble two-weapon fighter, to the deadly marksman, and everything in between.</p><h2>Deadeye Sniper</h2><p>The distant cough of a concussion rifle, the wet thud of an impact, and an extremely recent widow screaming in terror: these are usually the only sounds indicating that a deadeye sniper has paid a visit. Such rangers are infamous for their uncanny accuracy with a blaster at all ranges, but prefer to be far away from their targets, carefully lining up crosshairs before pulling the trigger. If at all possible, a sniper is an unseen foe, using range and stealth in equal measure to pick off their foes.</p><h3>No-Scope</h3><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you ignore the Sighted property of weapons you wield.</p><h3>One Shot, One Kill</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you begin to practice a style of combat that promotes precision over volume of attacks. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d8 damage to the target if you haven't moved since the beginning of your last turn.</p><h3>Concealed Position</h3><p>At 7th level, given enough time, you can prepare hidden sniper nests. A sniper nest takes 10 minutes to construct and occupies a 10-foot square area. While inside the nest, you have three-quarters cover and can see out of it unhindered. Neither you nor the nest can be seen by any creature or sensor more than 30 feet away, even if you make an attack from inside, though you can still be heard and detected by divination spells that penetrate more than one inch of solid material. A creature within 10 feet of the nest can detect its presence with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. Once you leave a nest, you can't benefit from it again.</p><h3>Overwatch</h3><p>Beginning at 11th level, if you are wielding a ranged weapon, and a hostile creature that you can see moves into or within the normal range of that weapon, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature using your ranged weapon.</p><h3>Disappear</h3><p>By 15th level, you are a true master of stealth, capable of fading into thin air. As a reaction when you take damage, you can use this ability to move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks and become invisible until the beginning of your next turn.</p><p>You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Reconnaissance Scout</h2><p>The ‘verse is harsh, alien, and above all, unspeakably vast, and reconnaissance rangers task themselves with being the first to explore it. When a ship comes out of a blind void jump, it’s far more likely to find itself orbiting a previously-undiscovered planet or star system than it is to be remotely near civilization. This is the time for a landing party.</p><p>Recon rangers lead landing parties through harsh, unfamiliar territories, derelict spacecraft, and deadly warzones. They are experts in identifying danger before it strikes and use every tool available to them to survive.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Piloting skill.</p><h3>Recon Drone</h3><p>At 3rd level, you gain a drone controller magic item linked to a recon drone. You can use your action to command this drone to fly to its maximum altitude and look out for danger, granting you advantage on initiative rolls against threats that the drone detects. Your drone remains in lookout mode, hovering high above you, until you command it to return to you.</p><h3>Dodge Roll</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can use your bonus action to move up to 15 feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, ignores difficult terrain, and can move you through hostile creature’s spaces, as long as you do not end your movement there. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Piercing Blast</h3><p>At 11th level, you can use your action to focus a blaster's shots to penetrate through its targets. You fire a 5-foot wide energetic blast, extending in a line out to the normal range of your blaster in a direction that you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). A creature takes the blaster's damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h3>Energetic Body Armor</h3><p>By 15th level, you wear an advanced shielding system which protects you from harm. Your shield grants you resistance to one of the following damage types of your choice: cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or radiant. You can change this selection as a bonus action.</p><h1>Rogues</h1><p>Crooks, criminals, smugglers, thieves; rogues in the 'verse have many names, none of them kind. Perhaps the most generous name applied to many rogues is \"Contractor,\" which signifies that they have a specific arrangement, a contract, with the Firm, the most notorious criminal organization in the 'verse. The Firm hires Contractors of all types, from the impressively strong, to the magically talented, to those with technological know-how, and signs them on for limited-time jobs. The Firm pays its Contractors well, and demands total compliance in return, no matter what they ask.</p><p>This association with the Firm and other criminal enterprises has soured the reputation of many rogues in the 'verse, who would rather use their resourcefulness and talents elsewhere. So-called \"independent\" rogues, like many smugglers and hackers, struggle to shake the stigma that clings to everyone in their profession, due in large part to the Firm and its contracts.</p><h3>Roguish Archetypes</h3><p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p><h2>Infiltrator</h2><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch04-infiltrator.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p>Trained in infiltration, espionage, and covert operations by the Firm, infiltrators excel at being completely untraceable agents of intrigue and subterfuge. Despite their vast array of skills, Infiltrators are primarily known for their proprietary Infiltration Rigs, nonmagical devices derived from gnomish tech, capable of an array of illusory, transformative, and technical effects.</p><h3>Espionage</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Data and Deception skills.</p><h3>Infiltration Rig</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you build your own infiltration rig, which is an interface rig extended with gloves, a visor, and a range of additional functions. While you wear it, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You can access arcane terminals, datapads, and ship computers from up to 30 feet away.</p></li><li><p>You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.</p></li><li><p>You can use your action to detect the location of surveillance devices within 30 feet.</p></li><li><p>You can cast the spell disguise self once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. At 9th level, you can cast the spell invisibility once, targeting only yourself, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. At 13th level, you regain the ability to cast these spells when you take a short or a long rest.</p></li></ul><p>Your infiltration rig can only be used by you, and you can only have one rig at a time. Should your rig be lost or destroyed, you can create a new one with 24 hours of work and 100 gp worth of materials.</p><h3>Spider Module</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“The contract was very specific: I needed to take the data book, leave behind a body, and make it all look like an accident somehow involving a thwirrel.”</p><p>— Kailynn Wraithwing, Firm contractor</p></blockquote></div><p>At 9th level, while wearing your infiltration rig, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p><h3>Hacking Spike</h3><p>Starting at 13th level, while wearing your infiltration rig, you gain advantage on all Intelligence (Data) checks made to disable security systems or to acquire sensitive data. Additionally, when you hit a construct with a Sneak Attack using a melee weapon, it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the construct is stunned until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being stunned.</p><h3>Predator Module</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, when you use your infiltration rig to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{invisibility}</em>, you can choose to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.tEpDmYZNGc9f5OhJ]{greater invisibility}</em> instead.</p><h2>Jumper</h2><p>Specialists in entry and exit, archetypal jumpers are trained in the art of leaping through space in the blink of an eye. Though most jumpers use specialized portal devices to teleport, some have gained their powers through near-catastrophic malfunctions with shipboard teleporters or other dimensional mishaps. Jumpers are essential additions to teams of smugglers and burglars —anyone who wants to get in and out of high-security areas quickly and quietly, without breaking down doors.</p><h3>Tele-step</h3><p>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can blink around the battlefield with ease. As a bonus action, you can teleport to any unoccupied location within 10 feet of you that you can see. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>This ability becomes more powerful as you gain higher levels in this class. At 9th level, this distance increases to 15 feet, and you can carry one willing passenger you touch with you when you teleport.</p><p>At 13th level, you can use this ability to teleport up to 30 feet to a location you can see. Once you use this ability to teleport this distance, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.</p><h3>Murder Hole</h3><p>By 9th level, you can quickly open portals on solid surfaces for ingenious weapon attacks. These portals only open for a brief moment, and only objects can pass through them. Once per turn, you can use this ability to make a melee attack against a target that is within 30 feet of you and within 5 feet of a wall, as if you were next to the target, or to make a ranged attack against a creature behind cover within 30 feet of you, as if the creature didn't have cover.</p><h3>Dimension Hop</h3><p>At 13th level, you can cast the spell dimension door without using a spell slot or spell components. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Evacuation Circle</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, you can cast the spell teleportation circle as a ritual, without using material components. Circles you create in this way can't be made permanent.</p><p>Additionally, you can create a destination circle each day by casting this spell using 50 gp worth of diamond dust as a material component. This destination circle lasts for 24 hours, or until it is used, after which it becomes inert. As long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination circle, you can use your action to teleport yourself and up to eight willing creatures within 30 feet of you to that destination circle.</p><img src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ch04-jumper.webp\" /><h1>Sorcerers</h1><p>There is magic in blood; there always has been, and there always will be. Sorcerers are arcanists by heritage, tracing their magic back to noble ancestries of dragons, demons, and angels, but others still acquire their sorcerous magic in their lifetimes, becoming the first in a new line of sorcerers. Because of the sheer prevalence of strange magical effects in the 'verse, sorcerers spawned by exposure to life-changing arcana outnumber those of magical bloodlines. Sorcerers who gain their power in this way, such as by being bombarded by radioactive voidlights, by being tinged by the darkness of a black hole, or by being infested with a swarm of nanobots, can never return to their old lives, and instead turn to adventuring, exploring, and mercenary work to practice their new magic and make ends meet.</p><h3>Sorcerous Origins</h3><p>Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: an eldritch bloodline and the influence of exotic magical energy.</p><h2>Nanite Host</h2><p>Whether by accident or design, your body is host to a colony of magical nanobots, called nanites. By drawing on their energy, you can command sorcerous power and compel the nanite swarm to do your bidding. Your relationship to the nanites is symbiotic: as you grow in strength, your connection to the nanites grows, until they become part of you on a fundamental level, influencing not only your body, but also your mind.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Technology skill.</p><h3>Nano-Repair</h3><p>At 1st level, you learn the mending cantrip if you don't already know it, and can cast it as an action. This spell doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p>In addition, as long as you are conscious, you can use a bonus action on your turn to expend one of your hit dice, roll it, and immediately recover hit points equal to the number rolled + your Constitution modifier.</p><h3>Improved Mending</h3><p>By 6th level, your nanites have become more adept at repair work. When you cast the mending cantrip targeting a vehicle with mega hit points, you can choose to expend any number of sorcery points to restore the vehicle as a whole. For each point you expend, you can repair 1d10 lost mega hit points to that vehicle.</p><h3>Mind-Machine Interface</h3><p>At 14th level, you develop a neural interface through which you can communicate with, and, to some extent, control your nanite symbiotes. You can speak the native code-language of machines, which you can use to interact with arcane terminals and ship computers from up to 60 feet away and to communicate with constructs, even if you don't share a language. Additionally, you can instantly decipher any encrypted messages you encounter.</p><p>Lastly, you can use your action to lock a machine or magical device that you touch, so that only you can access it. Any other creature that attempts to use the device finds that it doesn't activate for them or respond to their commands. Devices remain locked for up to 1 day, and you can have up to 3 locked devices at one time.</p><h3>Reboot</h3><p>When you reach 18th level, your nanites enable you to reset yourself quickly after being knocked unconscious, and help you to store your memories so they can't be tampered with. When you regain consciousness after dropping to 0 hit points, you immediately regain an additional 4d6 + 4 hit points. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Furthermore, you are immune to any spell or ability that would alter your memory or personality.</p><h2>Radiation Freak</h2><p>The depths of space hold terrible forces that can warp and twist a man irreparably. For example, the hideous lights emanating from the Void, typically called radiation, normally offer a cruel, agonizing death to those who see them, but can sometimes fundamentally alter those subjected to its strange energies. This process is called \"the warp\", and those who survive it are deemed “radiation freaks” or “warped ones” for the horrible physical deformities that accompany their transformation. However, some are changed in even stranger ways. Radiation has the potential to alter a creature at the magical level as well, resulting in mutated sorcerers wielding horrific power.</p><h3>Radioactive</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, your body is saturated with harmful residual radiation. You can use your action to activate or suppress a radioactive aura. While active, your body glows with a bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Additionally, each creature which comes within 5 feet of you or starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage. At 6th level, this damage increases to 1d8, and at 14th level, this damage increases to 1d10.</p><h3>High Power</h3><p>At 1st level, whenever you deal cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, you can replace the damage type with radiant damage.</p><h3>Adaptive Resistance</h3><p>By 6th level, the tumors within your body can rapidly shift your magical metabolism. After you take damage, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type until you take a short or long rest, or until you use this ability again. You do not gain resistance against the damage that triggers this ability.</p><h3>Glow Cloud</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to transform your entire body, along with everything you’re wearing and carrying, into a cloud of dangerous radioactive material. This effect acts as the gaseous form spell, with the following differences:</p><ul><li><p>Your flying speed is equal to half your movement speed.</p></li><li><p>If another creature enters your space or starts its turn there, it takes 4d10 radiant damage.</p></li><li><p>You can cast cantrips while you’re in this form. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></li></ul><h3>Isotope Poisoning</h3><p>At 18th level, as an action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to bombard a creature you touch with a near lethal amount of radioactivity. At the beginning of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the beginning of its next turn and takes 4d10 radiant damage. If a target fails three times, it remains poisoned for one hour, and takes 1d10 radiant damage at the beginning of each of its turns. If it succeeds three times, this effect ends.</p><h1>Wardens</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Warden</h4><p>This subclass makes use of the Mage Hand Press Warden class and its accompanying rules. This class can be found for <strong>free</strong> on <a href=\"https://magehandpress.com/category/content/mage-hand-press-classes/warmage\">magehandpress.com</a></p></div><p>When the poor, weak, and defenseless cry out, wardens answer. These mighty guardians are chosen to be sentinels for vulnerable worlds and lone outposts. Every warden is impelled by a call, most often to protect individuals, but sometimes to defend an idea from those that would despoil it. Whereas a paladin chooses their oath, a champion's call irresistibly draws its warden, and it is on the warden alone to honor it.</p><p>Throughout the 'verse, many wardens are called to defend the galaxy from profoundly dangerous threats: extra-galactic entities, sinister factions, and reality\u0002damaging technology. Few things are more important, and wardens seldom turn their back on calls of such enormity.</p><h3>Champion’s Call</h3><p>A warden’s call is a binding charge to protect and defend others from harm. Every warden eventually hears a call, and responds with mighty deeds. In answering this call, they embrace the traits of those they stand to protect, gaining primal, and sometimes even mystical, abilities.</p><h2>Lawbringer</h2><p>Lawbringers hear the steady, unyielding call of universal law and follow it without question. This set of invisible guidelines organizes the universe into its current state, but deviations from it threaten to destabilize all of creation. Reckless reality changing, time travel, and immortality are all violations of this law, and must be punished. Lawbringers are summoned to enforce laws both magical and mundane, and to deliver punishment when necessary.</p><h3>Axiomatic Mark</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, lawbreakers can never escape your mark. When a creature you have marked within 30 feet of you moves, you can use your reaction to move up to half your movement speed. You must end your movement closer to the marked creature than you began.</p><h3>Astute</h3><p>At 3rd level, you have advantage on ability checks you make to discern if a creature you can see is telling the truth.</p><h3>Mandate</h3><p>At 6th level, you can cast the spell command once without using a spell slot. This spell targets each creature you choose within 30 feet of you, using the same command for each target. The saving throw for this ability is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Clockwork Mind</h3><p>Starting at 13th level, your mind is a fortress, unbendable and unbreakable. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. Whenever you succeed on a saving throw against an enchantment spell or an ability that attempts to cloud your thoughts or control your mind, the caster takes 4d6 psychic damage. Universal Axiom At 20th level, as an action, you can transform into an embodiment of universal law, a ticking construct of inevitable intent. For 1 minute, you gain the following features: • You can't be exhausted, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned. • You have advantage on all saving throws. • You can use your Mandate ability at will. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h1>Warlocks</h1><p>When most people of the ‘verse stare up at the night sky, a twinkle of wonder and curiosity glistens in their eyes; warlocks, however, shudder at the black chasm of the sky, for they have seen what dwells in the great beyond and know the horror that awaits travelers to the stars. Warlocks that travel the ‘verse in search of eldritch secrets often uncover things far more terrifying than they bargained for. Out among the stars, the antediluvian patrons are more ancient, more enigmatic, than terrestrial beings, and offer darker secrets to their followers. These patrons might be colossal alien beasts, strange entities sequestered away within stars or black holes, or the ever\u0002present Void itself.</p><h3>Otherworldly Patrons</h3><p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p><h2>The Singularity</h2><p>Most denizens of the galaxy think that the ravenous chasms known as black holes are simply portals to the Void, formed from the collapse of particularly large stars. This theory brings them a sense of understanding to these dangerous galactic phenomena, and imparts a sense of control and comfort to those who would otherwise despair in the face of such a terrible, destructive force of nature.</p><p>However, the small group of warlocks who draw their power from these black holes know better: The Singularity is intelligent, malevolent, and, above all, hungry.</p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>The Singularity gives you the power to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p><h4>Singularity Expanded Spells</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ksaaTxIbKx2sJfia]{inflict wounds}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BrBZdCCrJRIVg7YX]{silent image}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.zwGsAv6kmwzYGhh3]{blindness/deafness}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.hJ6ZiA3fpoY8v9cp]{darkvision}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Szvk5FEVQW3uhJi5]{haste}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.yqUDoxk4x0NWG5Bz]{slow}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.spells.BmUmMD0kkW6TqA6R]{intensify gravity}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BYNvBJzHcF5VJhXw]{phantasmal killer}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JQyigMNPiDnGI18b]{geas}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.HQfd7jJyULIoGxrZ]{telekinesis}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Hunger of the Void</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, you can channel the ravenous hunger of The Singularity to absorb energies directed at you. When you are damaged by an effect or attack that deals damage of a type other than bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier. When you do so, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level.</p><h3>Brink of the Void</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can induce terror and despair by showing others the truth of the Void as an action. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Accretion Disk</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, whenever you use your Hunger of the Void ability, you can surround yourself with a swirling disc of damaging energy. For a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, or until you use this ability again or dismiss this effect on your turn (no action required), any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of you takes damage equal to your warlock level of the type you avoided. Event Horizon Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can summon a 20-foot radius sphere of pure voidstuff, centered on yourself. The first time a creature enters the area on its turn or when it starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 7d6 necrotic damage and is restrained until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and moves through the area as difficult terrain. You can concentrate on this effect, as you would a spell, to maintain this sphere for up to 1 minute. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you have advantage on checks you make to control spheres of annihilation.</p><h2>The Star</h2><p>It is impossible to comprehend the unbridled power contained within a star: an infinity of nuclear reactions, a constant explosion, unceasing for millennia—the ultimate inferno. It’s no surprise that someone would seek to harness some of this power for their own.</p><p>With the right words of forgotten lore, warlocks can do just that, drawing some small fraction of the howling flames into themselves. The Star is not a sentient patron, it doesn't demand sacrifices or worship from its warlocks; it is a beacon in a sea of black, a force of nature that will long outlive any living thing.</p><p>Though the annals of history do not recount their battles, warlocks of The Star have waged endless war with those of The Singularity, who seek to plunge the galaxy into perfect darkness.</p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>The Star gives you the power to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p><h4>Star Expanded Spells</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5SuJewoa1CRWaj1F]{burning hands}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LWTUqKkUQdMAmOe0]{color spray}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f]{continual flame}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7u2obDvuvtZBkTfq]{scorching ray}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{daylight}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{fireball}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.avD5XUtkBPQQR97c]{fire shield}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6]{wall of fire}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.TkJ8Wtg1L7TZtspm]{dispel evil and good}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{flame strike}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Bonus Cantrips</h3><p>You know the light and produce flame cantrips. These cantrips count as warlock spells for you, and don't count against your number of cantrips known.</p><h3>Nova</h3><p>At 1st level, you can unleash your Star’s fury in earnest. However, if you channel its energy for too long, it will consume your mortal body. You can use your bonus action to enter a Nova. When you enter a Nova, and each subsequent turn you begin while your Nova is active, you take special radiant damage called Nova damage. This damage begins at 1d6 when you enter your Nova, and increases to 2d6 the following turn, 3d6 the turn after, and so on. This damage can’t be reduced or avoided. You don't make Constitution saving throws to maintain your concentration as a result of taking this damage. Your Nova ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you use your bonus action to end it.</p><p>While your Nova is active, you can add bonus d6s of damage, up to a maximum of twice the number of Nova damage dice you have taken on your turn, when you damage a creature with an attack on your turn. You can choose to add all the damage dice to the roll of a single attack, or divide up the damage among multiple attacks. For example, if you take 3d6 Nova damage, you have 6d6 bonus damage to add to your attacks on your turn.</p><h3>Solar Flare</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, if you drop to 0 hit points while your Nova is active, you can choose to instead drop to 1 hit point and cause each hostile creature within 30 feet of you to take radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level. Your Nova ends.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Healing Rays</h3><div class=\"box-right\"><blockquote><p>“If that organic touches my datapad again, he is going out the airlock.”</p><p>— Unit 43, aka \"The Finger,\" vect warlock</p></blockquote></div><p>At 10th level, the Star’s soothing rays can mend even your severest of wounds. When you begin your turn in direct sunlight and your Nova isn't active, you can use your action to regain 1d6 hit points.</p><p>You can heal yourself a number of times using this ability equal to your Charisma modifier and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. At 14th level, this healing increases to 1d10.</p><h3>Supernova</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, when you enter a Nova, you can choose for your Nova damage dice and the additional damage you deal to other creatures to be d10s, instead of d6s.</p><h1>Warmages</h1><div class=\"box-right\"><h4>Warmage</h4><p>This subclass makes use of the Mage Hand Press Warmage class and its accompanying rules. This class can be found for <strong>free</strong> on <a href=\"https://magehandpress.com/category/content/mage-hand-press-classes/warmage\">magehandpress.com</a></p></div><p>For generations prior to the advent of space travel, the College of Warmages operated as a mercenary force, with few, if any, political ties. They trained legions of warriors in a simple, yet extremely effective style of magic which made them nigh undefeatable on the battlefield.</p><p>Initially based on Camberly, a world now in the heart of Hegemony territory, the College quickly became a major player in the Human Alliance. However, when the Rift War split human-controlled space in two, it similarly divided the College. Many of those who remained in the newly-formed Hegemony found themselves frustrated with generations of College leaders who had turned the organization away from its original purpose. To this end, the College built inroads with the Coalition and endeavored to move their base of operations to Fraxus-8.</p><p>Warmages who served with Lakshay, standing against the onslaught of the Warhorde, were offered a place of honor in the court of General Sun Wokung. Seizing the opportunity to forge something more meaningful than a mercenary force, the warmages of Lakshay founded the Court of the Celestial Lion, enveloping their previous warmage houses into their new organization and establishing a new house, the House of Lancers. Loyal only to Lakshay and its general, the Court quickly became the backbone of Lakshayan military might.</p><h3>Warmage Houses</h3><p>Within the College, different warmages are divided into separate Houses, each of which emphasizes a different approach to combat.</p><h2>Coalition Arcanist</h2><p>Adapted to the modern scale and complexity of interstellar warfare, warmages of the Coalition blend the tactics of the College with formidable blaster technology. Squads of these arcanists form the backbone of Coalition special forces, as their firepower and discipline are unmatched, even among Coalition troops.</p><h3>Coalition Blaster Gauntlet</h3><p>Starting when you choose this house at 3rd level, you gain a specialized spell focus known as a blaster gauntlet, which allows you to apply some of the traits of blasters to cantrips you cast through it. If the gauntlet is lost or stolen, you can requisition another one from the Coalition when you take a long rest.</p><p>Whenever you cast a warmage cantrip that deals damage and requires a ranged spell attack using the gauntlet as a spell focus, you can apply one of the following modifiers:</p><p><em><strong>Automatic.</strong></em> You can cast a cantrip twice, targeting two different creatures within 15 feet of one another with the spell. Your spell attacks for this cantrip always have disadvantage, regardless of circumstance.</p><p><em><strong>Scatter.</strong></em> Shooting at a close range target, you increase the cantrip’s damage dice by one die size for the attack. For example, if the cantrip deals d6s for damage, it deals d8s instead. If it deals d8s, it instead deals d10s, up to a maximum of d12s. This cantrip can’t target a creature further than 10 feet from you.</p><p><em><strong>Sighted.</strong></em> You can cast a cantrip at up to double its range. If its target is beyond its normal range, the spell attack has disadvantage. Tactical Uplink Starting at 7th level, you are fitted with a neural implant, granting you unparalleled battlefield awareness. You can use an action to gain knowledge of the general lay of the land within a 1-mile radius of yourself. This knowledge only extends to surface-level or obvious features (natural or artificial), and doesn't detect creatures of any sort.</p><p>Additionally, you gain a +5 bonus to your passive Perception score.</p><h3>Requisition</h3><p>By 10th level, you can requisition magic items from the Coalition’s armory for short term use. When you finish a long rest, choose one of the following magic items, which is teleported to you: 2 <em>attractor mines</em>, a <em>dome projector</em>, a <em>gravity nullifier</em>, a <em>jetpack</em>, a <em>ring of spacewalking</em> (which is attuned to you automatically), or a <em>universal translator</em>. This item remains in your possession for 24 hours, at which time it is teleported back to the Coalition’s secure armory.</p><h3>Squadsight</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, your tactical uplink synchronizes you with your allies, granting you a decisive tactical advantage. While you are within 120 feet of an ally, you know the exact location of any creature that your ally sees. Additionally, you can use a cantrip to target a creature that your ally can see, as long as that creature isn't in cover from your ally’s perspective. This cantrip is fired like a mortar, ricocheted off obstacles, or fired through thin barriers to hit its target.</p><h3>Orbital Bombardment</h3><p>At 18th level, you are granted access to the Coalition’s vast fleet of orbital drones, which are teleported to your location. You can cast the spell <em>orbital hardlight cannon</em> without using a spell slot. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>House of Lancers</h2><p>Warmages who join the House of Lancers become trained in fluid Lakshayan martial arts, and learn to meld this style of combat with their potent spellcasting. Serving as the shock troops for Lakshay’s battles, members of this house blink effortlessly around the battlefield, felling foes and winning battles with their bare hands and raw arcane might.</p><h3>Intercept Technique</h3><p>Starting when you choose this house at 3rd level, you adopt the Lakshay principles of offensive protection. While you are unarmored or are under the effects of mage armor, you can add your Intelligence, rather than your Dexterity, to your Armor Class.</p><h3>Hand-to-Hand</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the Lancer’s secret unarmed combat technique, granting you the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You can use Intelligence instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.</p></li><li><p>Your unarmed strikes count as melee weapons for the purposes of warmage spells.</p></li><li><p>Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</p></li></ul><h3>Shock Trooper</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, can rapidly close the distance between you and your foes. Whenever you make a melee attack on your turn against a creature you can see, you can lunge up to 15 feet toward your target before making the attack. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. You can perform this movement even if it causes you to travel through the air, though you fall after making the attack if you do not land on solid ground.</p><h3>Mystical Physicality</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of the normal modifier.</p><p>In addition, moving through rough terrain no longer costs you additional movement.</p><h3>Deflect Energy</h3><p>By 10th level, you can deflect bolts of energy with your bare hands. As a reaction when you are hit by a ranged spell attack or a ranged weapon attack which deals cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, or radiant damage, you can use your reaction to deflect the bolt. The damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier + half your warmage level (rounded down).</p><h3>Improved Shock Trooper</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, you can lunge up to 30 feet using your Shock Trooper ability. This movement causes you to teleport through creatures and objects, blinking to the target in an instant. You can’t end your movement in an occupied space.</p><h3>Flurry of Spells</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can cast spells with superhuman speed. As an action, you can expend a use of your Arcane Surge ability to cast three different cantrips which have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action. You can’t use your Arcane Surge feature on any of these cantrips.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Warmage Tricks</h2><p>If a Warmage Trick has prerequisites, you must meet them to choose it. You can choose a Trick at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p><h3>Directed Momentum</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 10th level, House of Lancers</em></p><p>Once on each of your turns, when you score a critical hit with a melee attack or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make an unarmed strike against a second target. If the target is within range of your Shock Trooper feature, you can lunge toward it. On a hit, this attack deals an additional 1d8 force damage.</p><h3>Encryptogram</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: cryptogram cantrip</em></p><p>Your knowledge of ciphers has improved your magically clandestine communications. When you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.spells.yP0arLLW1ynI7Di7]{cryptogram}</em> cantrip, its limit is 20 characters, instead of 8, and only the specified recipient can read the message.</p><h3>Gauntlet Upgrade</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Coalition Arcanist, 10th level</em></p><p>You install a high-power module in your blaster gauntlet. You can apply one of the following two modifiers to cantrips that you cast using your Coalition Blaster Gauntlet ability.</p><p><em><strong>Beam.</strong></em> The cantrip creates a 5-foot wide beam out to the spell’s range in a direction you choose. This beam lasts until the start of your next turn. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take the spell’s damage.</p><p><em><strong>Overheat.</strong></em> The cantrip’s damage dice become d12s.</p><p>Once you use one of these modifiers, you can’t use them again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Leading Edge Tactics</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: Coalition Warmage or House of Lancers</em></p><p>You always have a plan when engaging the enemy. As such, attacks during the first round of combat have disadvantage against you.</p><h3>Technomancer</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: technomancy cantrip</em></p><p>Your constant exposure to magical technology has given you the ability to manipulate it almost subconsciously. You can cast the cantrip technomancy as a bonus action on your turn, and can do so without using somatic components. Additionally, you can use the cantrip to attempt to hack devices within range.</p><h1>Witches</h1><p>Dark curses come in many malevolent forms, but the most sinister of it is infectious, worming its way into its victim and devouring them from the inside. Witches are individuals afflicted by such a curse, but are not struck dead by its malady; instead, they learn to suppress and even control the curse's darkness, using it for their own.</p><p>Covens of witches that form out in the 'verse practice eerie, mystical arcana, and can purportedly divine the future from constellations on certain worlds. Though wholly unproven, it is said that some witches can even concoct a poultice to replicate the effects of consuming a Roach. Their familiars, too, are unusual, often tiny creatures native to far-off worlds, thrwirrels being a favorite.</p><h3>Witch’s Craft</h3><p>A witch's craft is distinct from a school of magic. Whereas magical schools seek to categorize spells, crafts are defined by the use of magic. Though others also exist, there are two primary crafts, White Magic, which seeks to mend and restore, and Black Magic, which seeks to rend and destroy.</p><h2>Lunar Magic</h2><p>The moon is a potent symbol for many witches, especially those who are forced to practice their art incognito. To them, it represents a guiding light in the darkness, a confidant or keeper of secrets, and a link to the powerful natural forces that govern time and tide. Lunar witches are the masters of the night: shadowy, quiet, and exceptionally difficult to pin down.</p><h4>Lunar Magic Bonus Spells</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Witch Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.nqBDWkVOfcGZt4YU]{faerie fire}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{sleep}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.hJ6ZiA3fpoY8v9cp]{darkvision}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.bV3yun6MIuFj71Er]{moonbeam}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.6g3WLOZ2u0EbaLAd]{hypnotic pattern}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.aU62xVUBYkAQWIHv]{nondetection}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9hQXdMSmerkTsHDe]{confusion}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.NJgxf7pmSsBArIG7]{private sanctum}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.kSPRpeIx3w3nihrF]{dream}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.mbFw57uyfLkyiw5k]{seeming}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Hex: Lunacy</h3><p>When you join this craft at 3rd level, you gain the ability to drive people mad. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers from one long-term madness effect, selected at random, until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Under Cover of Darkness</h3><p>By 6th level, you have developed a supernatural affinity for shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can take the Hide action as a bonus action.</p><h3>Everlasting Night</h3><p>At 10th level, you can use your accursed powers to suppress light around you. As an action, you can cause all areas of direct sunlight within 300 feet of yourself to become bright light, bright light to become dim, and dim light to become total darkness for 10 minutes. Sources of light are still visible; only the illumination they provide is reduced. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you take a short or long rest.</p><h3>Moonsight</h3><p>At 14th level, you can see through illusions with ease. You have truesight out to a range of 60 feet and you perceive a shimmering halo of moonlight around any creature you can see that has the shapechanger subtype.</p><h1>Wizards</h1><p>Nearly all of the cornerstone inventions—arcane batteries, Dark Matter engines, starships, and intelligent constructs—were pioneered by brilliant engineer-wizards, long before gadgeteers and more traditional arcanist\u0002wizards parted paths. In Dark Matter, wizards can have any one of a myriad of roles, and can focus their magic on hundreds of subschools and specialties, but they largely fall into those two main categories: engineer-wizards, which study practical applications of magic, especially as it relates to groundbreaking technologies, and arcanist\u0002 wizards, which are concerned with the practice of magic itself in the purest sense. Regardless of their specialty, all wizards push the envelope of arcane understanding through research and experimentation, and are a force to be reckoned with.</p><h3>Arcane Tradition</h3><p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the 'verse, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p><p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p><h2>School of Automata</h2><p>Inspired by the practicality of gadgeteers, wizards in the School of Automata depart from the traditional realm of scholarly book-smart mages in favor of a hands-on, mechanical approach to their magic. These so-called mechamancers use their expertise in mechanist's tools, engineering, and the principles of magical technology to animate obedient automatons to follow their every command. Typically, mechamancers reside some distance away from the dangers of exploring, while their creations engage in the unpleasantness of combat on their behalf.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Technology skill and mechanist's tools.</p><h3>Engineering Savant</h3><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can fashion and animate constructs that serve at your command. When you prepare spells following a long rest, you use your mechanist's tools and spend spell slots to raise a collection of mundane parts into mechanical constructs. Once you have expended a spell slot to make a construct, you can't regain that slot until the construct is disassembled (requiring 10 minutes of work) or drops to 0 hit points. Different constructs cost different number of spell slot levels and can only be created when you have enough levels in this class, as shown on the Constructs table above. You can expend one or more spell slots to create each construct, as long as you meet or exceed the number of slot levels required. You can have up to 3 constructs at one time.</p><p>When you take a long rest, you can repair your constructs to their full hit points. You are always considered to have enough scrap and material to create and repair your constructs.</p><p>Your constructs act on your turn, though they don't take actions unless you command them to. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any of your constructs within 60 feet of you, issuing a command to each one. You can decide what action the construct will take and where it will move. If you command your constructs to attack, each construct makes only one attack. Alternatively, you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If a command is too complex for a construct to follow, or if the construct is unable to follow it, it spends its turn motionlessly considering the command. Otherwise, once given an order, the construct continues to follow it until complete.</p><p>The connection to your constructs is taxing, and you can't magically summon or command any other creatures while your constructs are active.</p><h4>Constructs</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Name</td><td>Spell Levels</td><td>Wizard Level</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.py3IEz86Zl1ravWA]{Defense Drone}</td><td>1</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.N539Hdt4xiS9scgt]{Mechanical Spider}</td><td>1</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.LxJlruHdHy0eFnit]{Medical Drone}</td><td>1</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.CXlVHsoms8PSH3kS]{Recorn Drone}</td><td>1</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.CMCZX3ixcfIZgQQf]{Single Task Automation}</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.FKMzBmU1lR2nFGZz]{Multi-Task Automaton}</td><td>7</td><td>11th</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Assault Programming</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your constructs add your Intelligence modifier to their attack and damage rolls.</p><h3>Construct Upgrade</h3><p>At 10th level, whenever you assemble a construct, you can apply one of the following upgrades to it. Each construct can have only one upgrade at a time, which you can switch when you repair it over a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Alloy Chassis.</strong></em> The construct's AC is increased by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Energy Plating.</strong></em> The construct has resistance to one damage type of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>High-Torque Motors.</strong></em> The construct's speed increases by 10 feet.</p><h3>Perfected Core</h3><p>By 14th level, you have perfected the construct cores that animate and control your automatons. You use your action to assume direct control of one of your constructs: when you do so, you can see through its senses, designate exactly where it will move, and choose what action it will take. While controlling a construct directly, if you command it to attack, it can make multiple attacks if it has the Multiattack trait.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Feats","type":"text","_id":"OBzdB2rwXFSpMf2d","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities.

You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.</p><p>You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.</p><p>These feats are broken up into four broad categories: @UUID[.OBzdB2rwXFSpMf2d#general-feats]{general feats}, which can be taken by any character that meets the prerequisites, racial feats, which can only be taken by members of a particular race, faction feats, which signify one’s allegiance with a faction, and ship feats, which directly relate to exemplars of ship combat.</p><h1>General Feats</h1><p>Whether it’s a unique style of blaster combat or an addiction to gambling, one solid personality trait can make a character stand out from the rest.

You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>By spending 1 minute observing or conversing with a creature, you can discern if that creature is a disguised construct, such as an android. If the creature is a construct or living construct, you can tell if the construct is malfunctioning and if the construct is infected with the N-Virus (even if the virus is dormant).</p></li><li><p>When a construct or living construct within 5 feet of you makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p></li><li><p>When you hit a construct with a melee weapon attack, you can cripple its joints.

You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain proficiency in all gaming sets and have advantage on ability checks you make for games of chance.</p></li><li><p>Once on each of your turns, before you roll damage, you can place stakes on the roll. Choose less than the average, or higher than or equal to the average. If you choose correctly, you can add one additional die of damage to the roll. If you choose incorrectly, you must remove the damage die with the highest number.</p></li></ul><h3>Genius</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Intelligence 15 or higher</em></p><p>Every successful starship needs at least one person with uncanny knowledge about most things.

Used in this latter way, role feats can serve to cement a character's permanent rank or job among the crew, or can be awarded to represent a character's experience aboard the ship. A character can have only one role feat awarded in such a way at a time.</p></div><p>Life on a starship is arduous, and those without proper training can find themselves completely unprepared to face the challenges posed by deep space.

In this case, awarding the feat is entirely up to the GM. A faction feat might be awarded the moment the characters sign up with a faction, after training with them for some time, or only after attaining a respectable rank within the organization. A character can have only one faction feat awarded in such a way at a time</p></div><p>Veteran adventurers are likely to make enemies across the 'verse , but if they're lucky, they might forge some alliances too. The greatest of these alliances are likely to be with factions, which provide work, services, and connections to spacers everywhere. Of course, such allies don't come free. Factions generally also require work and commitment from their members, which might come in the form of small tasks, important favors for higher ranking members, or even regular obligations for the organization. For their efforts, adventurers can gain specific and useful skills from their factions, as represented by the feats below:</p><h3>Agent of the Tower</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Member of the Tower</em></p><p>As a fully-inducted Agent of the Tower, you are familiar with the organization’s cryptic ciphers, secret codes, and arcane symbols, and are trained in their clandestine, magical arts.

If you already know <em>prestidigitation</em>, you can instead learn any other wizard cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p></li><li><p>When you cast a spell, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to disguise the spell’s casting. The DC equals 12 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, you can cast the spell without its verbal or somatic components (your choice).</p></li><li><p>You can use your action to magically muffle your movement and hasten your step. For the next minute, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to hear you move, and your movement speed increases by 5 feet. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you take a long rest.</p></li></ul><h3>Archon</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Member of the S.S.

After examining an object for one minute, you can determine the object's exact market value; as well, if it is a magic item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any.</p></li><li><p>You can attune to four magic items, instead of three.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to barter, buy and sell goods and services.</p></li></ul><h3>Cabal Broker</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Member of the Cabal</em></p><p>You have passed the legal and ritualistic exams necessary to become a bonded soul broker for the Cabal.

As a chaplain, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain proficiency in the Religion skill.</p></li><li><p>You can cast the spell worldseek once without expending spell slots or spell components. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></li><li><p>As an action, you can pray to the Chosen for guidance while aboard a ship. Choose one creature in a role aboard your ship. The next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that creature makes as a part of their role has advantage on that roll. </p></li></ul><h3>Coalition War Training </h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Member of the Coalition</em> </p><p>For joining the Coalition, you have received marksman training to make the most out of the standard-issue carbine, which confers the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain proficiency with the repeater and the standard carbine.</p></li><li><p>When you make an attack with a carbine you are holding in two hands and you don't fire it automatically, its damage increases to 2d8.</p></li><li><p>Using a system of silent hand signals, you can communicate tactical information, such as how many enemies are in sight, where your allies should move, and when to attack. </p></li></ul><h3>Grax's Guy </h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Member of Grax’s Guys for Cheap</em> </p><p>Grax’s Guys are known for being tough, adaptable, and able to get the job done; you’re no different.

You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill and with shields.</p></li><li><p>While using a shield, if you are within 5 feet of a friendly creature and you both must make a saving throw against an effect that would deal damage, you can use your reaction to give that creature advantage on its saving throw. If you do so, you automatically fail your saving throw against that effect. If the creature would take half damage from succeeding on that saving throw, they take no damage instead. </p></li></ul><h3>Starguide </h3><p><em>Prerequisite: Member of Astrogations Inc.</em> </p><p>As a starguide, you are uniquely qualified for the task of charting unknown systems and braving the Galactic Frontier. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain proficiency in Investigation.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on saving throws you make against natural hazards, such as radiation and high gravity, that you encounter in space and in harsh planetary environments.</p></li><li><p>You can add 5 whenever you roll on the Blind Jump table for an unassisted jump.

Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a galactic peacekeeper or a grizzled space marine. Your wizard could have been an engineer or a medical doctor. Your rogue might have joined the thieves’ network or piloted a commercial ship.</p><p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is <em>what changed</em>? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have <em>more</em> money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?</p><h1>Commercial Pilot</h1><p>For every ace fighter pilot or sky pirate, there are hundreds of completely unremarkable civilian pilots, who make their livings ferrying goods, people, and information between the stars. These commercial pilots may not have much combat experience, but they do spend a large portion of their lives at the controls, and surely know their ships better than anyone else.</p><p>There are many reasons why a civilian pilot might become an adventurer. It is not uncommon for trained pilots to be dragooned into service in military fleets during times of crisis; likewise, pilots are often asked to step up to protect their ships, crews, and cargos from the many dangers of space. Some pilots enter the profession fully expecting a life of adventure, looking forward to the opportunities they will have to travel and explore.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:  </strong>Perception, Piloting <br /><strong> Tool Proficiencies:  </strong>Ship maintenance tools <br /><strong> Languages:  </strong>Any one of your choice <br /><strong> Equipment:  </strong>A partial map of a distant star system, a badge or insignia from your flying school, a pair of aviator glasses, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp</p><h3>Previous Ships</h3><p>When you choose the pilot background, you should consider what sorts of ships you have flown in the past, and perhaps think of names for some of them.

Exiling these people allows the authorities to remove a thorn from their sides without creating a martyr or having to keep the unwanted person in costly perpetual captivity. Many a coup or revolution has resulted in the leaders and courtiers of the old regime being consigned to exile, sometimes on a moon or neighboring planet, sometimes on the other side of the ‘verse.</p><p>On occasion, a person may choose exile voluntarily, either as an alternative to something worse or because they desire time on the Frontier to grow and develop. An exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures and contact émigré communities while rallying support remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the impetus to accept a self-imposed exile.</p><p>Exiles take to adventuring for a number of reasons. For some, their exile was only temporary, and now they seek to embark on a dangerous journey home, while others might seek to foment rebellion in absentia so as to be welcomed as liberating heroes on their return. Some exiles are gripped by wanderlust, traveling the world with a small group of companions. The unluckiest of all, however, might find themselves unwelcome everywhere, with no choice other than to continue wandering forever.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:  </strong>Deception, Survival <br /><strong> Languages:  </strong>Any two of your choice <br /><strong> Equipment:  </strong>A @Compendium[dnd5e.items.0E565kQUBmndJ1a2]{dagger}, a small strongbox, a memento from your homeland, a set of @Compendium[dnd5e.items.8RXjiddJ6VGyE7vB]{common clothes}, and a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.9bWTRRDym06PzSAf]{pouch} containing 5 gp</p><hr /><h3>Feature: @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.pWXeYr7Ptn1kG9Yl]{Exile Network}</h3><p>You keep in touch with a network of exiles and expatriates, who possess an eclectic mix of skills and the durable spirit of pioneers.

On the civilized worlds, maws, and other places where disparate peoples gather, professional interpreters are almost indispensable. Without them, business and diplomacy would be impossible, and misunderstandings and conflict would surely fill the void.</p><p>Living in such vibrant places, it is only natural that interpreters should get caught up in the adventures and machinations of great people, and perhaps even rise to greatness themselves. The benefits they bring to an adventuring party, including information gathering and the ability to communicate with a wide range of individuals, are not to be sniffed at.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:  </strong>Insight, Persuasion <br /><strong> Languages:  </strong>Any two of your choice <br /><strong> Equipment:  </strong>A phrasebook, identification documents, a small recording device, a set of @Compendium[dnd5e.items.3OXueEpvDDCVfGFA]{fine clothes}, and a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.9bWTRRDym06PzSAf]{pouch} containing 10 gp</p><hr /><h3>Feature: @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.9CvSFxeb4Y1vC4VN]{Flawless Protocol}</h3><p>You have memorized a vast library of basic greetings, handshaking techniques and polite gestures from a thousand different cultures.

The technology level of these planets range from as primitive as spears and bone tools, to as advanced as modern Earth. However, without the innovation of faster-than-light travel or the intervention of a galactic faction, the peoples of these planets will never join the galactic community.</p><p>Low-worlders find themselves far from home through a variety of different means. Sometimes, their journeys are purposeful, a planet's first rocketborne steps to the stars above, but most often low-worlders stumble into the wider universe by sheer accident. Mishaps with powerful dimensional or teleportation magic, abductions, and stowing away on visiting spacecraft are all common stories among low-worlders.</p><p>Universally, low-worlders are foreigners in the 'verse, discombobulated for several years as they learn the basics of their new surroundings. The dizzying array of races baffles them and the mundane prevalence of spacecraft and other technology astounds them. Despite their naivety with technology and galactic culture, low-worlders often possess finely honed skills forgotten by much of the wider 'verse: you can find no better tracker, fletcher, cobbler, or blacksmith than those from the low worlds.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:  </strong>Persuasion, Survival <br /><strong> Tool Proficiencies:  </strong>One set of artisan's tools and one type of gaming set <br /><strong> Equipment:  </strong>A token of your homeworld, a set of @Compendium[dnd5e.items.8RXjiddJ6VGyE7vB]{common clothes}, a container holding currency from your homeworld (worth 0 gp)</p><hr /><h3>Homeworld</h3><p>You can use the following tables to decide on the technology level of the world from which you originated and to determine how you left it.

Each of them, however, knows that their position is utterly unique; they are among the very few from their world to have stepped out among the stars, a fact they will likely wear with pride, even as they are confused and awe-struck by their new setting.</p><p>[[/r d8]] Personality Trait</p><ol><li>I constantly make jokes and pop-culture references to things from my own world.</li><li>I try my best to understand the technology of the 'verse, but I'm constantly out of my depth.

Whether exploring the far reaches of the ‘verse, where untold alien pathogens lurk, going to war in one of the great space fleets and staring down alien weapons, or simply dealing with the crew’s cybernetic implants going haywire, the ship’s doctor never knows what challenges they might face from day to day.</p><p>Pragmatic out of necessity, but always seeking to provide the best possible care for their patients, shipboard medics are natural candidates to be made clerics of healing gods, and often possess an intellectual capacity well-suited to the demands of wizardry. Some, wishing to become self-sufficient in terms of potion supply, become interested in alchemy, while others make warlock pacts to gain more power with which to help more people. In this way, it's not uncommon for ships’ doctors to transition into a more intense adventuring life.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:  </strong>Investigation, Medicine <br /><strong> Tool Proficiencies:  </strong>@Compendium[dnd5e.items.SztwZhbhZeCqyAes]{Alchemist's supplies}, @Compendium[dnd5e.items.i89okN7GFTWHsvPy]{herbalist’s kit} (Note: Tools have to be purchased.) <br /><strong> Equipment:  </strong>A @Compendium[dnd5e.items.6rocoBx5jdzG1QQH]{healer’s kit}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.JpBERO5uQUsVQjZh]{a book of psychology}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.C12AzYGEwt9ig9fo]{a needle and string}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.dyISoVgTbRUbemIF]{a doctor's uniform}, and a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.9bWTRRDym06PzSAf]{pouch} containing 10 gp</p><h3>Feature: @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.sfsCtVaNHxmkC5M8]{Xenobiology}</h3><p>Having seen many strange things on your travels, you have developed an instinctive understanding of alien biologies.

Technologists are experts in repairing, tuning, and decommissioning the devices that other people rely on for their employment, comfort, and safety. Therefore, they are in constant demand everywhere, from heavilyindustrialized foundry worlds near the galactic core, to the Frontier worlds on the rim. Moreover, any ship of significant size is likely to employ engineers to keep it flying, regardless of where it finds itself in the ‘verse.</p><p>Technologists come in all shapes and sizes, so there are lots of reasons why they might become adventurers. It could be that they are drawn to the challenge, or that they seek to uncover arcane secrets that can be incorporated into their machines. Some might have gotten their start as hired helpers for an established adventuring party, while a surprising number turn to druidry, having become so sick of malfunctioning technology that the only option is to cut it out of their lives altogether!</p><p>Skill Proficiencies: Data, Technology <br />Tool Proficiencies: @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.equipment.mpgoFtw3dYLi7Xx1]{Mechanist's Tools}, one set of artisan’s tools (Note: Tools have to be purchased.) <br />Equipment: A set of @Compendium[dnd5e.items.0d08g1i5WXnNrCNA]{Tinker's Tools}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.kAB9aw3NcCUBH5H7]{a broken piece of a mysterious machine}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.7UkIvCD5RyKfeHr3]{a large pipe wrench} (counts as a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.Ajyq6nGwF7FtLhDQ]{mace}), a set of @Compendium[dnd5e.items.8RXjiddJ6VGyE7vB]{common clothes}, and a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.9bWTRRDym06PzSAf]{pouch} containing 10 gp</p><hr /><h3>Feature: @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.backgrounds.VLB8teK3zjNOs0hL]{Vent Tape and Elbow Grease}</h3><p>Invariably, technologists find themselves needing to repair things without access to the proper tools, training, or spare parts, having to make do with temporary stop-gap measures and whatever they happen to have on hand.

For example, Survival becomes a critical skill in navigating unfamiliar and hostile alien environments, and Insight might be used to understand the behaviors of alien races. In addition, there are brand new skills that will be necessary to survive and thrive in the unforgiving 'verse. This section will explore new uses for conventional skills in Dark Matter and will introduce the new skills that will be important in any science fiction campaign. </p><h1>Strength </h1><p>Even in a far-flung setting of robots and blasters, there's sometimes no replacement for brute strength. Your Strength check covers your ability to push, drag, lift, run, jump, and break things, and your Athletics check reflects specific types of Strength checks. </p><p><em><strong>Athletics.</strong></em> As always, your Strength (Athletics) check covers any physically imposing situation, from lifting heavy objects, to running, swimming, or climbing. In a science fiction setting, this might extend to various activities during zero-gravity spacewalks or high-gravity environments. Of course, a high Strength (Athletics) check might also be used to overpower or disable a construct that would otherwise have the upper hand. </p><p><em><strong>Other Strength Checks.</strong></em> In addition to the normal uses of a Strength check, the GM might call for you to make a Strength check when you attempt any of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Smashing a terminal or blaster.</p></li><li><p>Standing up and moving around in high-gravity environments.</p></li><li><p>Climbing a rocky ravine on an uncharted world.</p></li><li><p>Manual maintenance of a spacecraft, such as replacing weapons or systems, without construct assistance.</p></li></ul><h1>Dexterity </h1><p>In a setting where high-power blasters can melt holes in steel plates and pilots can dogfight in zero-gravity, it pays to have a deft hand and fast reflexes. Your Dexterity checks govern your ability to be swift, quiet, or precise, skills which have become exponentially more important with advancing technology. </p><p><em><strong>Acrobatics.</strong></em> As in a conventional setting, your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check determines how nimble you are and governs your body control in specific circumstances, such as balancing on a narrow ledge, performing a flip, or keeping your footing in a tricky situation. Your GM might ask for these checks to avoid falling when your ship is hit by an unshielded blast, when you try to balance on the ledge of a tall building, or when you try to move quickly in zero-gravity. </p><p><em><strong>Piloting (New Skill).</strong></em> A new skill in Dark Matter, your Dexterity (Piloting) check covers how well you maintain control over a ship in difficult circumstances. You don’t need proficiency in Piloting to fly a ship (be it an aircraft or a spacecraft), but proficiency in this skill can help when you need to make a crash landing or pull off a risky maneuver in a dogfight. The GM might call for a Dexterity (Piloting) check when you attempt to fly a ship through an electromagnetic storm that disrupts the controls, or when you wish to perform a hard stop or pull a high-G turn. </p><p><em><strong>Sleight of Hand.</strong></em> In science fiction settings, blasters, datapads, and gadgets are the chief domain for the Sleight of Hand skill. This skill determines how well you can conceal objects on your person, slyly pilfer them into your pockets, plant objects on others, and otherwise furtively move small things about. You will likely require a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to hide a blaster (such as a phaser) on your person, draw and aim a blaster at a close target without their knowledge, swap a datapad with a fake, or use any gadget or magic item stealthily. </p><p><em><strong>Stealth.</strong></em> Whereas Sleight of Hand governs how to sneakily move objects, Stealth governs how well you sneakily move or hide yourself. Dexterity (Stealth) checks are required to sneak around a hostile ship, hide in the flora of a jungle world, carefully creep up on a guard, or slip out a door unnoticed. </p><p><em><strong>Other Dexterity Checks.</strong></em> Dexterity checks might also be called for in the following situations:</p><ul><li><p>Flipping a blaster around in an impressive manner to perform a trick shot.</p></li><li><p>Tossing a concussion grenade through a distant exhaust port.</p></li><li><p>Balancing several things in your arms at once.</p></li><li><p>Quickly performing a well-rehearsed sequence of actions, such as disassembling and reassembling a device. </p></li></ul><h1>Constitution </h1><p>Constitution measures your bodily toughness, your ability to take a punch, and your ability to withstand pain. Though there are no skills directly tied to Constitution, this score determines your all-important hit points, and is therefore indispensable in any campaign.</p><p><em><strong>Other Constitution Checks.</strong></em> Your GM might call for a Constitution check to accomplish any of the following tasks:</p><ul><li><p>Maintaining consciousness in extreme g-forces, such as when maneuvering a fighter above its maneuverability limit or passing near a black hole.</p></li><li><p>Withstanding high-voltage shocks or extreme temperatures.</p></li><li><p>Resisting the pangs of Roach addiction.</p></li><li><p>Breathing through air choked by smoke, sand, or vapors. </p></li></ul><h1>Intelligence </h1><p>An acute mind, technical insights, and an expansive education are invaluable assets in any science fiction setting. Though the Intelligence score, which measures one's acuity, logic, and memory, has always been important to a number of skills in conventional campaign settings, it takes on a role of paramount importance in Dark Matter, for Intelligence is the singular tool one uses to modify and exploit technology. </p><p><em><strong>Arcana.</strong></em> The Arcana skill reflects your knowledge on a wide range of magical subjects, from understanding the theory and practice of spellcasting, to comprehending the planes of the multiverse, to recalling lore about magic items. Importantly, however, the Arcana skill doesn't govern magical technology, which includes ships and most of the magic items that are included in this book— that knowledge is encompassed in the Technology skill. The GM might call for an Intelligence (Arcana) check when you examine a strange dimensional anomaly in space, when you need to determine which type of spells or spellcaster might have caused a particular effect, when you must unravel a heretofore unseen magical effect, or when you try to understand esoteric magical concepts, like the nature of a vect's soul. </p><p><em><strong>Data (New Skill).</strong></em> This new skill in Dark Matter governs how well one can manipulate a technological interface and gain access to information or other functions. Your Intelligence (Data) check encompasses your knowledge of software and its exploits, more than hardware (which is covered by the Technology skill), and so will only be used when you use technology that has an interface, like a datapad, an arcane terminal, a ship's computer, or other control technology, like a door control or the computers that govern a shield generator or ship weapon. If a piece of technology doesn't have an interface, an interface rig is required to interact with it. The GM should call for an Intelligence (Data) check whenever you attempt complicated operations on a data system, when you attempt to reprogram a construct, or when you attempt to hack a device. </p><p>Any sort of illegal or unauthorized access to a technological system is called <strong>Hacking</strong> and requires the use of an interface rig, as well as an Intelligence (Data) check. In general, a hacking attempt requires 1 minute of work using the technology, though the GM can decide that certain tasks might take only an action. On a successful check to hack a device, you can perform operations on the system as if you had full access. On a failed check, roll a d6. On a 6, the device locks down and no further attempts can be made to hack it. More secure devices might lock on a roll of 5 or 6, or on a roll of 4 to 6, as determined by the GM. You can hack into devices to illegally access a security system, open a door, disable an alarm, or manipulate someone else's datapad to give you access to their information or bank account.</p><p><em><strong>History.</strong></em> In Dark Matter, the History skill is far broader than in other campaign settings, for it encompasses history from all across the galaxy, as well as xenogeography, the study of distant worlds. An Intelligence (History) check can reveal facts about recent or ancient wars, insights about important figures, living and dead, the different worlds that are controlled by the elves or avia-ra, or the differences between the Hegemony and Lakshay. Additionally, if you are marooned on a strange planet, this can help determine the planet's identity, provided the planet has been noted in historical record. </p><p><em><strong>Investigation.</strong></em> As always, your Intelligence (Investigation) check measures your active attempts to search for something, and governs your deductions about what you find. This check covers detective work of all kinds, from finding hidden objects, patterns, or clues, to determining what kind of blaster made a particular blast mark, to analyzing a ship for structural weaknesses. </p><p><em><strong>Nature.</strong></em> As with History, the Nature skill is vastly expanded in <em>Dark Matter</em>, for it covers knowledge of animals, plants, and terrain, from all across the galaxy. For those exploring the outer reaches of the galaxy, this skill is indispensable. An Intelligence (Nature) check might be used to determine if an alien atmosphere is poisonous, to recall or deduce information about an unusual alien plant or creature, to understand the strange day-night or weather cycles of an alien world, or to determine what kind of foods are edible on that world. Additionally, this skill can be used to determine the identity of a planet, provided the planet has been visited before and has some sort of unique natural characteristic.</p><p><em><strong>Religion.</strong></em> Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore from thousands of different religions and myths from across the 'verse. This includes both modern dogma, like that held by the avia-ra or the Temple of the Chosen, and ancient traditions, like the old gods of High Terra or the honored dwarven pantheon. A successful check can help you identify the holy symbols of a cult, recall the rites and prayers of the avia-ra, or identify the marks of divine magic. </p><p><em><strong>Technology (New Skill).</strong></em> Your Intelligence (Technology) check measures your ability to understand the inner workings of technological devices. Most devices are powered by some form of magic, but plenty of intricate design goes into channeling that magic into useful effects. Use this skill to understand unfamiliar or complex technology or to modify or repair devices. The GM may call for an Intelligence (Technology) check when you attempt to modify a blaster, repair your ship's shield generator, disable a rogue android, or sabotage an arcane terminal. </p><p><em><strong>Other Intelligence Checks.</strong></em> Your GM may call for Intelligence checks to accomplish any of the following tasks:</p><ul><li><p>Solving a cypher or a riddle.</p></li><li><p>Estimating the value of a ship's cargo.</p></li><li><p>Reading corrupted data on an arcane terminal.</p></li><li><p>Calculating the trajectory of a falling spacecraft.</p></li><li><p>Winning a logic game against a construct. </p></li></ul><h1>Wisdom </h1><p>In many ways, Wisdom is the silent ability score. It governs your connections to the world at large, and your experience within it, which in turn influences your intuition, awareness, and decision-making skills, especially when a gut call needs to be made or a moral conundrum presents itself. </p><p><em><strong>Animal Handling.</strong></em> In <em>Dark Matter</em>, your Wisdom (Animal Handling) check governs how you interact with animals, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial, domesticated and wild. This check applies to a myriad of alien beasts and might be useful when attempting to ride a strange alien horse-bird or when calming down a baby spaceshark. </p><p><em><strong>Insight.</strong></em> Understanding a creature's motivations, intentions, and emotional state is the domain of your Wisdom (Insight) check. This skill is especially useful when a foreign (or alien) language or culture acts as a barrier for communication; a successful check can elucidate another creature's intents, even across such gaps. You can use this skill in lieu of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.equipment.MltDSXOCJXVaueNT]{universal translator}</em>, or when encountering an alien race that doesn't communicate using conventional language or telepathy. </p><p><em><strong>Medicine.</strong></em> You use a Wisdom (Medicine) check to stabilize dying allies and to diagnose illnesses. The result of this check chiefly reflects your medical experience, but in a setting like Dark Matter, can also be used to make guesses about alien biology or pathology. This is exceptionally useful when a party consists of a wide range of races from across the galaxy. </p><p><em><strong>Perception.</strong></em> As always, you use a Wisdom (Perception) check when you attempt to notice, detect, spot, or hear something. If you are not actively looking for something, your GM might use your passive Perception score instead of asking for you to roll a check. This skill is often contrasted with the Intelligence (Investigation) check, which is used when you're searching for something specific (or checking if something specific is present), whereas the Wisdom (Perception) check measures whether or not you've noticed something out of the ordinary. You can use this skill to check for the sounds of an ambush, notice the tell-tale signs of ships flying overhead, or sense if someone is getting ready to fire a concealed blaster. </p><p><em><strong>Survival.</strong></em> The Survival skill is a critical for those exploring the universe, especially when touching down on strange, alien planets. This skill is normally used to hunt, follow tracks, and gather food, but in Dark Matter, a Wisdom (Survival) check can also be used to determine which types of alien plants and animals are edible, dangerous, or intelligent, to navigate unseen alien environments, and to predict the weather (and weather\u0002like phenomena) on alien worlds. Additionally, this skill can be used to determine the identity of a planet, provided the planet has been visited before and has some sort of unique natural characteristic. </p><p><em><strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong></em> Your GM might call for a Wisdom check to accomplish any of the following tasks:</p><ul><li><p>Determining if a newly-discovered creature is intelligent, hostile, or both.</p></li><li><p>Following a gut feeling of whether to fight, flee, or negotiate with an unidentified ship.</p></li><li><p>Figuring out if the smuggler lost your blasters, or stole them.</p></li><li><p>Understanding the bad feeling that you get when flying into an asteroid field. </p></li></ul><h1>Charisma </h1><p>Across the many worlds of the 'verse, the power of persuasion is the one skill guaranteed to make you coin and friends, whether it's in a Halfling Hearthstation or in the halls of the Solar Citadel. Adventurers and traders who have a forceful personality are often referred to as 'Faces' for their ability to put a friendly face on any situation. Many Charisma skills are fundamentally unchanged in Dark Matter, but their contexts will be far more important, as the reputations these skills shape can spread across the 'verse faster than any ship. </p><p><em><strong>Deception.</strong></em> Your Charisma (Deception) check determines how well you can lie, withhold information, or otherwise mislead others. This skill can cover everything from lies of omission, to misrepresenting true facts, to full-scale con jobs. You might use this skill to fast\u0002talk your way onto a starship without registering, lead inspectors away from smuggled cargo, disguise yourself on a hostile world, conceal your intentions from a sepulcher knight, or tell a blatant lie to an orcish warlord. </p><p><em><strong>Intimidation.</strong></em> When you choose to use direct threats, physical coercion, or even subtle statements of future retribution, your GM might ask you to use a Charisma (Intimidation) check. You might employ these tactics when interrogating a Tower agent for information, shaking down a shopkeep for a few coins, or when you intend to frighten a petty thug into leaving you be. </p><p><em><strong>Performance.</strong></em> Whether it's singing a ballad or entertaining a crowd with some simple magic tricks, your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can enthrall an audience and entertain individuals. </p><p><em><strong>Persuasion.</strong></em> When diplomacy is in order, you can influence someone using the Persuasion skill, pulling out all manner of charm, tact, and convincing arguments in order to influence someone. Your Charisma (Persuasion) check is normally used as a catch-all for convincing someone through conversation, as long as your methods don't more appropriately fall under Deception, Intimidation, or Performance. You might use this skill to win allies to your side with a quid pro quo argument, convince an intelligent monster to delay consuming you until after it has taken a long nap, or convince an amoeboid scientist to share its research with you. </p><p><em><strong>Other Charisma Checks.</strong></em> Your GM may call for a Charisma check to accomplish any of the following tasks:</p><ul><li><p>Convincing a skathári to board a starship or use a blaster.</p></li><li><p>Negotiating a tense dinner party with the elven upper\u0002class.</p></li><li><p>Making friends with bizarre, undiscovered near\u0002humans.</p></li><li><p>Negotiate a temporary peace with an intergalactic army.</p></li><li><p>Enrapturing a crowd during a gladiatorial battle.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.nrrhqxUR6W3i6HGs"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bjgntohdazs"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1667413288549,"modifiedTime":1668640012942,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"qh90SPE3i0Shb0qZ"}
{"_id":"t049BVcz9qh5afKW","name":"Race - Avia-Ra","content":"<h1>Avia-Ra</h1>\n<p><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/avia-ra-final-sm.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"353\" /></p>\n<p>The bird-headed avia-ra might almost be confused for humans from the neck down, but unlike the scores of nearhumans that pervade the galaxy, the avia-ra are unrelated to humanity. Hailing from Kemet, a harsh, desert planet, crisscrossed by rivers and lakes, they have always known an appreciation for the sun’s blessings and cruelties, which forms the backbone of their religion, inspires their arts and sciences, and informs their view of the cosmos. Their dogma centers squarely on their deity and holy star, the Sun Above, to which there can be no equal. When the avia-ra took their first tentative steps into spaceflight, however, their religion bent and adapted to the wider universe in which they found themselves. Suddenly, their Sun Above was no longer Deshret, the star around which their homeworld orbits, but a theoretical “true star” from which all stars, including their own, derive meaning. It was centuries before they ventured to the center of the galaxy and encountered what they consider the physical embodiment of the Sun Above: the Sepulcher Star.</p>\n<p>  In those days, the Sepulcher Star orbited much further from the black hole at the galactic core, and it was definitively under elven control. The avia-ra soon learned from the elves that the Sepulcher Star wasn't merely a star, but contained some sort of supermassive construct within. Though strictly an academic curiosity to the elves, this discovery galvanized the avia-ra: in the heart of this star, near the exact center of the galaxy, was their Sun Above. Over the next few centuries, the avia-ra quietly bolstered and gathered their fleets in preparation for the First Crusade.</p>\n<p>  This was the first of many Crusades, bloody battles between the avia-ra and the elves for control of the center of the galaxy. Each crusade was punctuated with the signing of a treaty, a respite from battle, and a consolidation of forces. Always, a surprise attack by one of the two sides reignited the conflict anew. In the Third Crusade, the avia-ra constructed the massive Solar Citadel in orbit around the Sepulcher Star—a holy city, built for the glory of the Sun Above and to deter elven aggression. In short order, it was seized by an elven sneak attack; ever since, the Citadel has become a flashpoint for conflict and a central focus for Crusades.</p>\n<h3>The Night Crusade</h3>\n<p>The most recent of these battles, called the Night Crusade, nearly saw the wholesale destruction of the Elven Empire. The holy avia-ra fleet, known as the Congregation, captured the center of the galaxy in a series of decisive victories and pushed the elves back to their home system. In this moment, the balance of the galaxy was threatened, and the elves struck a bargain: in exchange for their assistance, the elves would liberate the vect across their empire—a move which would eventually pave the way for vect freedom across the ‘verse.</p>\n<p>   The culmination of this deal was at the Battle of Alden’val, where the vect fleet turned the tide for the elves, critically wounding the avia-ra’s flagship, The Prophet. The ensuing retreat made an opening for the Elven Forest-Fleet, which encircled the Congregation, spelling the end of the Crusade. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty Black, a document that quieted hostilities and established the Order of the Sepulcher to safeguard against similar crises in the future.</p>\n<h3>Depths of Dogma</h3>\n<p>To some, the avia-ra’s captivating dogma, high priesthood, and Congregation warfleet represent a light and peace in the ‘verse, but to others, it represents a simmering kettle, just waiting to boil over.</p>\n<p>   In the past, the avia-ra have found little success spreading the message of the Sun Above to the established races of the 'verse. After all, their pantheons are extensive and integral to their societies; a monotheistic god has little place among them. Instead, the avia-ra have turned to primitive civilizations, especially those on undiscovered planets, with which to share their message.</p>\n<p>   The pattern for their evangelism is simple: build a civilization on an undeveloped world, founded on the philosophy of their solar religion, reside with it long enough to ensure it leaves a lasting legacy, and depart once again for the stars. In the avia-ra religion, all worship of the sun is indirectly worship of the Sun Above, so any evolution their gods of light and flame take on with the passing of centuries is inconsequential; they are still effigies of Old Un in the Sepulcher Star.</p>\n<p>   This practice is controversial, to say the least. Many worlds have ancient tales of travelers from other worlds, bringing with them the blessings of the Sun, and these depictions paint them much like gods themselves. Humans, especially, have a sore spot for this sort of unfair proselytizing—High Terra was an early target for avia-ra evangelists. Elves and dwarves hold their own pantheons as sacred, and condemn avia-ra missionaries as a whole, but there is little that the galactic community can do, short of inciting galactic war. Thus, avia-ra evangelism occupies an uncomfortable, but tolerated position in the galaxy.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\"><em>Upon the Black and Night Crusade,</em></span><br /><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Rode the fearless, heroes they.</span><br /><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Citadel, unto their grasp,</span><br /><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Fleets adjoined; O' pilgrim's wrath.</span><br /><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Prostrate ‘fore the Sun Above,</span><br /><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">All to arms – never love.</span></p>\n<p><em>— 3rd Hymn of the Night Crusade</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The avia-ra are a sun-worshipping race of wingless birdmen, which appear to primitive cultures to spread their ancient religion.</p>\n<h2>Ancient God-Kings</h2>\n<p>Depictions of the avia-ra can be found in the ruins of ancient cultures throughout the galaxy. Often, but not always, they are portrayed as divinity manifest: god-like travelers from the heavens. They arrive as evangelists to share the philosophy of their solar religion—that the Sun Above is the only true god—and remain long enough to build an enduring civilization on the primitive world.</p>\n<p>   Some races consider the avia-ra an ancient and wise people, dedicated to their religion and its tenets. Others cast them as charlatans and false prophets, who routinely prey upon primitive and defenseless peoples. The truth depends largely on perspective, but the avia-ra view themselves only as a grand tool to carry the momentum of the sun's glory to new peoples.</p>\n<h2>Watchers of the Citadel</h2>\n<p>The heart of the avia-ra's religion is at the Solar Citadel, which revolves close around the Sepulcher Star. Most aviara make pilgrimage to this site at least once in their lives to bask in the rays of their holy sun, which (in their philosophy) gives light and meaning to all other stars. Their worship of the sun is always directed at the Sepulcher Star itself, even if they are nearer to another star or to no star at all. All other stars merely act as a metaphor, a symbol, for their holy sun.</p>\n<p>   In contrast to their binary doctrines, their actual relationship to the star and the Sepulcher within it is more complicated. The Solar Citadel definitively ensures that the star is under avia-ra control, but Old Un has never spoken to the avia-ra directly from within the star. Despite the silence, the avia-ra continue to pray in reverence and make pilgrimage to the Sepulcher Star.</p>\n<h2>Deep Symbolism</h2>\n<p>Avia-Ra are inclined to view the events around them as omens of much larger struggles, such as those between light and dark, good and evil, and law and chaos. All things have symbolic importance to them; even fundamentally objective things like science and mathematics have a place in the underlying allegory for avia-ra.</p>\n<p>   Most avia-ra hold dreams in especially high regard, for interpreted dreams can tell the future, lend insight into the past, or provide guidance for the present. Those with the gift to interpret dreams are honored highly as priestsin the avia-ra and given elaborate titles, such as Grand Remembrancer, or Dream-Teller Most High.</p>\n<h2>Avia-Ra Names</h2>\n<p>Avia-Ra names come in two-part cartouches, with one or both parts of the name being composed of the names of ancient avia-ra heroes and great ideals.</p>\n<p>Front Cartouche.

{"_id":"xPWLIWLXkWj13E09","name":"Race - Dwarves","content":"<h1>Dwarves</h1>\n<p><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/dwarf-finish-sm.webp\" width=\"306\" height=\"250\" /></p>\n<p>Gruff, inventive, and stalwart, the dwarves of the ‘verse are nearly identical to those living planetside. Despite spending most of their time in massive fleets of mining and war ships, star dwarves are just as comfortable in the bowels of a mountain as their terrestrial brethren. Indeed, the dwarves who make up the Galactic Dwarven Conclave know that the biggest and richest mountains to be mined are, in fact, asteroids drifting aimlessly through the Black.</p>\n<p>   While terrestrial dwarves deviate into distinct branches based on familial lines, star dwarves, especially those from their homeworld of Jormund, take on traits which make them sturdier than their terrestrial brethren. The high gravity of their homeworld strengthens their bones and ensures their short, stocky stature, and a life spent doing industrial labor toughens their muscles into steel.</p>\n<p>   Dwarven expansion into space took a somewhat different route than most, in that there was little in the way of war or conquest. Ages before they discovered spaceflight, the dwarves had already founded the beginnings of the Conclave, which drove the interests of their entire race forward under one banner. When they began expanding out into the galaxy at large, they found that, although Jormund was host to all manner of life, the surrounding systems were barren. What they lacked in inhabitants, however, they made up for in mineral wealth. True to their nature, the dwarves turned their skill, magic, and technology towards the mining of these planets, and converted the influx of material into the largest mining and freighting fleet in the galaxy. To this day, no other interstellar race can match the raw material wealth or manufacturing skill of the dwarves, a fact which the Conclave would like to ensure.</p>\n<h2>The Granite Throne</h2>\n<p>From the outside, Jormund, the second of three planets orbiting the star Jotun, seems like the least likely place to find a thriving race of people: it is a desolate ball of rock, pockmarked with craters, nearly devoid of atmosphere, and constantly blasted by radiation. Just below this stark surface, though, Jormund teems with life, not the least of which are the dwarves themselves.</p>\n<p>   The oldest dwarven records recall that Jormund once flourished with surface life. Eons ago, long before the dwarves fashioned their first ships from mountains and rockets, a great cataclysm befell the planet, forcing life on the planet to flee underground. The details of the old cataclysm are lost to time, for conflicting stories tell of different disasters, from a war caused by the greed of an ancient dwarven king, to the folly of an invention crafted by a mad blacksmith, to the poisonous breath of a spiteful dragon which contaminated the skies.</p>\n<p>   Despite being sequestered away under the surface, the subterranean dwarven cities are true marvels of engineering. Their tunnels stretch deep into the planet, some reaching nearly to its core. The highest cities, which reach the surface itself are full of brisk winds and titanic granite stonework, while the lowest cities, nestled in artificially-cooled pockets within molten rock, are humid places of stunning obsidian towers. Indeed, within its rocky caverns and carved halls, the planet’s interior, called the <strong>Granite Throne</strong>, can house nearly every inhabitant of dwarven space. This becomes a requirement at least once a generation, as each dwarf dedicated to the Conclave makes the journey home to elect two of their elders to supreme leadership, that of the Matriarch and the Patriarch.</p>\n<h2>The Adamantine Fleet</h2>\n<p>Despite their peaceful expansion to the stars, dwarves retain every ounce of their legendary ruggedness, their love of strong drink, and their fury in battle. Dwarven soldiers and smiths are held in high regard across the ‘verse as potential mercenaries or crew members⁠—many even think having a dwarf aboard is good luck. Dwarven spacecraft are praised just as highly: the Adamantine Fleet may not be as large as the Hegemony Armada nor as swift as an Elven Forest-Fleet, but its ships are nearly impossible to destroy. Coupled with the dwarven tendency to experiment with explosives, even a single dwarven ship can make for an astonishingly frightening foe.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Star Dwarf</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Star dwarves hail from the dwarven homeworld of Jormund and its associated colonies. They are tough and stout, with a low stature caused by the high gravity of their worlds. Living most of their lives underground or inside ships, these dwarves are pale-skinned and often grow stark white beards. Star dwarves are taught the principles of ship design and engineering from an early age and are among the finest shipwrights in the ‘verse.</p>\n<p>Star dwarves are a subrace of dwarves with the following statistics:</p>\n<p>     <strong>Ability Score Increase. </strong>Your Strength score increases by 2.</p>\n<p>     <strong>Speed. </strong>Your speed isn't reduced in high gravity or extreme gravity.</p>\n<p>     <strong>Dwarven Engineering Training. </strong>You have proficiency with the Technology skill and with ship maintenance tools.</p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/dwarf-finish-sm.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Q5FXLK3NFJd4llvW"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ktslxkevw8","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"xh5FVWG7LTgZAAaK","name":"Chapter 6: Ships","content":"<h1>Chapter 6: Ships<img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"25%\" height=\"25%\" /></h1>\n<p>Be it for planet-hopping exploration, high-stakes smuggling, or white-knuckle dogfighting, no campaign in <em>Dark Matter</em> is complete without a starship. This chapter details how to use Dark Matter engines, ship statistics, crew roles, ship combat, and space exploration. Additionally, it includes a plethora of ship options.</p>\n<h2>Ship Traits</h2>\n<p>The common saying goes: \"No two ships in the 'verse are alike.\" Though any mechanic will tell you that this isn't exactly true, the meld of magic and technology spacefaring vessels employ to cross the gulfs of space vary in thousands of ways. Even ships laid down in the same yard to the same specification are likely to go through multiple refits, overhauls, and repairs during their lives, leaving them unrecognizable after a few years in the Black. For most purposes, ships are described by statistics which include the following information:</p>\n<p>Size classification, hit points, shield points, Armor Class, engines, systems, crew, cargo, cost, challenge, and<br />weapons, all of which are detailed below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More details for how these statistics are used can be found in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h3>Size Classification</h3>\n<p>Ships are categorized according to their <strong>Size Classification</strong>, which generally determines other important aspects: its crew size, top speed outside of void jumps, maneuverability, and durability. For example, a larger ship might be able to carry more men and guns, but a smaller ship can outrun and outmaneuver it. Different size classifications are detailed in the Size Classification table below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ships also mention which race generally builds that type of ship. This has no mechanical effect on its own; instead, it gives an impression about which types of creatures might be piloting them, and what statistics you can expect from that type of ship. For example, Hammers, which are dwarven fighters, are sturdily built, and possess a higher Armor Class than many other fighters as a result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the Ship Classification table indicates the size of a ship in feet and its size using the optional Grid Combat rules. The sizes listed are maximum sizes.</p>\n<h4>Character Level</h4>\n<p>A typical adventuring party might begin their adventures with a modest personal ship and invest in larger, more capable vessels as their fortunes grow. Larger parties, however, will find the cargo space and crew capacity of a transport ship essential. At very high levels, characters might enlist a crew to man a frigate or even an entire fleet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, a party&rsquo;s character level has no bearing on ship size (and by extension, ship combat power), but a GM can award a party with larger ships as they grow in level. As such, the Ship Classification table also includes a recommended character level for some ship sizes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 638px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"426\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 138.5px;\" width=\"93\" /> <col style=\"width: 161.5px;\" width=\"121\" /> <col style=\"width: 186.5px;\" width=\"143\" /> <col style=\"width: 148.5px;\" width=\"69\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"height: 15.0pt; mso-ignore: colspan; width: 161pt;\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"214\" height=\"20\">\n<h2><em>Dark Matter Ship Classifications</em></h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 107pt;\" width=\"143\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"width: 52pt;\" width=\"69\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">\n<h3>Classification</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">\n<h3>Dimensions (feet)</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 107pt;\" width=\"143\">\n<h3>Dimensions (squares)</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl68\">\n<h3>Rec.

If you&rsquo;re not sure how to create new stats or how to interpret an effect happening at starship scale, remember that hit points and<br />damage (which use mega points), movement speed, and ship scale are generally scaled up by 100 times. This can provide a good rule of thumb when a quick decision is necessary at the table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h3>Armor Class</h3>\n<p>Like creatures and structures, ships have an Armor Class (AC). Unlike creatures, however, a ship&rsquo;s Armor Class is&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly literal: it represents how heavily armored a ship is and determines how successful an attack is likely to be.</p>\n<h3>Mega Hit Points</h3>\n<p>The damage necessary to injure and kill the hardiest of men is paltry compared to the durability and lethality of&nbsp; an entire starship. Therefore, ships use Mega Hit Points, instead of regular hit points, to describe their damage and repair. A single mega hit point equals 100 hit points. A ship&rsquo;s hit points represent the resilience of its hull.</p>\n<h3>Shield Points</h3>\n<p>In addition to hit points, many ships have Shield Points, (expressed in mega points) which determine how much damage can be absorbed by the ship's shield. Shields are always created by a shield generator system and are controlled by the ship&rsquo;s engineer.</p>\n<h3>Engines</h3>\n<p>Ships generally have two Engine types, a Dark Matter engine to perform void jumps, and an Impulse engine, used to maneuver when not in the Void. Each impulse engine has a given Speed in hundreds of feet per turn and a Maneuverability score, measured in degrees, which determines a ship's cone of movement. More information about engines can be found in the Dark Matter Engines section, and more information about movement can be found in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h3>Systems</h3>\n<p>Everything from essentials, like a ship&rsquo;s life support or sensors, to peripheral functions, like tractor beams and teleporters are encapsulated in a ship&rsquo;s Systems. The list of systems available to a ship are detailed in the Systems section.</p>\n<h3>Crew</h3>\n<p>The ship's Crew indicates the roles that are available to characters in the ship. If a Dogfighter role is available, the entry in parentheses indicates the default type of ship that the dogfighters pilot. For more information on how to use the crew roles, see the Ship Combat section. Note that most ships will have room for passengers that won't actively take a role in ship combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the need arises, a ship can temporarily take on more passengers than it can safely support. Doing so taxes the life-support, however, and can only be performed for a short time. For each day that the ship is above its passenger capacity, every passenger onboard gains one level of exhaustion. These levels of exhaustion can&rsquo;t be removed by those aboard until the ship is once again below capacity.</p>\n<h3>Cargo</h3>\n<p>Each ship has a fixed Cargo capacity, which indicates the amount of cargo the ship can carry.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>Most ships can be bought and sold at docks and starports throughout the &lsquo;verse, and therefore have an included Cost. This price is a typical figure for a ship of its type, but unscrupulous (or simply ignorant) merchants might sell ships for a far higher or far lower price.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all ships have an included cost; the very largest and most powerful of ships are ostensibly priceless and are never bought or sold at market.</p>\n<h3>Challenge</h3>\n<p>Like monsters, ships have a Challenge rating to help GMs compose challenging encounters using them. When determining encounter difficulty, it is best to use the average of the party&rsquo;s level and their ship&rsquo;s challenge rating as the party&rsquo;s effective level.</p>\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<p>Ship-mounted weaponry comes in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes, from physical battering rams, to extremely large flamethrowers, to deployable mines, but the most common ship-mounted Weapons are based on the same principles as handheld blasters. They are, nonetheless, singularly destructive, capable of melting clean through armored hulls in a single shot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship armaments are explained in the Ship Weapons section, with additional details on their use in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h2>Dark Matter Engines</h2>\n<p>Spacefaring vessels in the 'verse are abundant and varied, reflecting hundreds of societies and their diverse technologies. Nearly all of them operate via a Dark Matter engine, a solid or latticework crystal structure surrounded by heat sinks, stabilizers, and other supporting equipment. These engines are powered by magic, allowing them to carry a ship on short jumps through the Void to cross vast gulfs of space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark Matter engines are the hearts of starships. Most ships also have other engines, called impulse engines, to travel outside of void jumps, but a Dark Matter engine is required to embark on any planet-hopping adventure.</p>\n<h3>Engine Class</h3>\n<p>Dark Matter engines can only jump twice a day, and most can maintain a void jump for only a short time before needing time to cool down and recharge. Therefore, Dark Matter engines are organized into Classes, from 1 &ndash; 9, based upon the length of their jumps. These Classes are detailed in the Dark Matter Engine Classes table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a spellcaster directly powers the engine using their magic, they can cause a Dark Matter engine to jump two more times on a given day. However, progressively more powerful engines require more arcane magic. A Class 1 engine can be powered by a 1st level spell slot, but a Class 2 engine requires a 2nd level spell slot, and so on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engines with the lowest classes are ostensibly systemhoppers, allowing a small starship to jump around a single system, or to go on longer journeys between nearby systems. Often, these types of ships will need to be carried within higher class starships to cross longer distances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 10 engines are strictly theoretical or legendary, depending on who you ask. Such an engine could cross the galaxy in a single day, requiring no spellcasters of any sort, and would have to be the direct creation of the gods, or some ancient, mystical alien race.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 175px;

Rare, fragile, and extracted from the Void at the event horizons of black holes, these crystals are among the most valuable and volatile materials in the 'verse. If a void crystal is damaged in the slightest, it risks not only becoming inoperable, but also collapsing into a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, destroying the rest of the engine and the entire ship. Thus, most of the stabilizing equipment surrounding the core of a Dark Matter engine serves only to insulate and protect the crystal within.</p>\n<h3>Running a Dark Matter Engine</h3>\n<p>To many, it seems that Dark Matter engines are temperamental and perplexing without end, behaving like living things unto themselves. No single race&rsquo;s designs and no particular model accurately represents the variety of these engines; even engines of the same model act differently when fed different types of magical energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a ship has long had a warlock working as an engineer, the Dark Matter engine may start to belch clouds of sulfur and brimstone, and charge faster when those aboard the ship are miserable. Wizards, on the other hand, keep rather tidy, if meticulously modified, engines, which are likely to pulse with rhythmic bursts of force when engaged in a jump. The variations are endless: engines run by illusionists chromatically aberrate the air around them, druid-kept engines sprout twigs and grass in their crevices, and some dwarven engines produce a small amount of beer as exhaust.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Charging a Dark Matter Engine</em></strong>. All Dark Matter engines, regardless of type, require significant energy to charge-up before a jump. Older or worn models of engine can take several hours of warm-up time, during which they must be fed a continuous stream of magical energy. In general, assume that an engine requires 1 minute of warm-up time prior to a jump.</p>\n<h2>Ship Weapons</h2>\n<p>Ship-mounted weapons are among the most lethal devices ever conceived. A direct shot with any of these massive weapons can vaporize an unprotected person, but no less is necessary to pierce the armored hull of a starship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship-mounted weapons are used by crewmen in the Gunner role. A character with martial weapons proficiency also has proficiency with ship weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship weapon damages are given in mega damage points.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Descriptions</h3>\n<p>These weapons are installed in ships across the &lsquo;verse, from amoeboid saucers to human warbringers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Auto Turret</em></strong>. This omni-directional twin blaster is fired from a swiveling, domed turret. Because of its rotating mount, the blaster is relatively small compared to other ship-mounted weapons, but it is capable of harrying other vessels from all angles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antimatter Mine</strong></em>. Antimatter mines are explosives designed to lay dormant until magnetically attracted to nearby targets. Each mine weighs around 1,000 pounds and are deployed from a launch tube, normally installed near a ship&rsquo;s cargo bay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Heavy Cannon</strong></em>. Ballistic weapons are uncommon in space combat, but not totally unheard of (and certainly not ineffective). A heavy cannon fires large-diameter explosive shells, which unlike blaster bolts, must lead their target to account for travel time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Light Cannon</em></strong>. Scaled-down versions of heavy cannons, light cannons trade sheer firepower for a faster rate of fire, greater density of stored ammunition, and more flexibility in mounting positions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lightning Coil</strong></em>. This enormous transformer draws a similarly large amount of power and generates arcs of lightning thousands of feet long. Because the lightning discharges toward any nearby target, the lightning coil is<br />actually omni-directional.</p>\n<p><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mining Laser</strong></em>. This laser and its turret deploy from a hatch on the ship, with a blast screen protecting it from loose debris. If allowed to focus on an immobile target, the laser grows hot enough to break chunks from solid asteroids.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Neutron Torpedo</strong></em>. This cigar-shaped missile carries a hefty neutron payload to its target. Unfortunately, the torpedo only carries a limited amount of fuel, limiting its maximum range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Pulse Cannon</strong></em>. One of the staple fixed-position blasters, the pulse cannon charges an incredible burst of energy in a large capacitor bank, before releasing it in a brilliant flicker of light. This weapon owes its popularity to its balance of firepower and range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Railgun</strong></em>. Conducting a ferromagnetic projectile down two conductive rails requires a frankly outrageous amount of power, but the results are hard to argue with. A railgun transfers so much kinetic energy into its projectile that it generally degrades into plasma en route to its target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Scorcher</strong></em>. Scorchers spit a narrow fan of flame from their mouths, normally with the intent of melting through the hulls of other ships or making them malleable enough to warp. Because of this uncouth design, scorchers trade range for the singular ability to bypass shield systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Starbuster</em></strong>. Starbusters are the largest blasters ever fashioned. By channeling six component blasters into a single, mighty beam, this weapon can rend entire ships in half. Its scale and power consumption mean that only the grandest of ships can shoulder it; of course, this also means that this weapon is as useful for deterrence as it is for defense.</p>\n<h3>Ship Weapon Properties</h3>\n<p>In addition to weapon properties presented in the Equipment chapter, shipbound weapons have special properties that are unique to their use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deployable</strong></em>. A deployable weapon releases a type of ammunition that separates from the ship, which might have a movement speed of its own, noted in parentheses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you make an attack using one of these weapons, you deploy the weapon within your ship&rsquo;s space. You make an attack roll using this weapon when it contacts another ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use a deployable weapon that has a movement speed, you can choose the direction it travels as a bonus action on your turn. A deployable weapon has a maneuverability of 90 degrees and begins facing in the same direction as the ship. Once a deployable weapon moves for 3 turns, it deactivates and begins drifting listlessly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deployable weapons can be targeted independently during flight. Each of these weapons has Armor Class 10<br />and 1 mega hit point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fixed</strong></em>. This weapon is mounted on one side of a ship and can only make attacks against targets within a 90-degree cone in the direction it is facing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Ship</strong></em>. A ship weapon is powered by a ship and must be mounted to one to fire. This weapon can&rsquo;t target any creature or object that is Huge or smaller.</p>\n<h3>Special Weapons</h3>\n<p>These ship weapons have special properties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antimatter Mine</strong></em>. If a ship other than your own with a Dark Matter engine comes within 1,000 feet of this mine, the mine detonates. When this happens, make an attack roll with the mine against the triggering ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lightning Coil</strong></em>. This weapon deals double damage to shield points, but half damage (rounded down) to hit points. If this damage reduces a ship&rsquo;s shields points to 0, remaining damage is not subtracted from hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Mining Laser</strong></em>. This weapon is designed to cut through immobile asteroids and other bodies of rock. It deals double damage to targets that have not moved in the last round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Scorcher</strong></em>. This weapon produces a scorching fan of arcane energy which heats a ship&rsquo;s hull without affecting its shields. Shields do not block this weapon's damage.</p>\n<h3>Ammunition and Deployable Weapons</h3>\n<p>Many ship weapons rely on blaster technology, which are powered strictly by the ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine, and don't require ammunition of any sort. Other ship weapons (especially those favored by gnomes) are more closely related to firearms in design and require ammunition, or deploy from the ship and fly independently, almost like separate vehicles. Ammunition and deployable weapons have independent costs and must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 295px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"659\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 150px;\" width=\"115\" /><col style=\"width: 58px;\" width=\"121\" /><col style=\"width: 191px;\" width=\"143\" /><col style=\"width: 294px;\" width=\"280\" /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15px;

This is called a broadside attack. When a ship makes a broadside attack, each mega creature and the pilot of each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking full damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Broadside attacks require a gunner, much like other attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A broadside attack can only be used once on each round. If a broadside attack is disabled, it can still be used to make an attack, but deals only half damage on a failed saving throw, and no damage on a successful save.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ship with broadside attacks can&rsquo;t replace them with other ship weapons.</p>\n<h3>Ship Melee Weapons</h3>\n<p>Some ships have tremendous built-in melee weapons, designed to crush, rip, and tear other ships into pieces. For use in especially close range, these weapons can target any other ship or mega creature in an adjacent square (a target within 500 feet). Ship melee weapons can&rsquo;t be replaced like normal ship weapons, nor can they replace normal ship weapons.</p>\n<h2>Systems</h2>\n<p>A ship relies on a myriad of technological systems to provide most of its noncombative functions. All ships have a ship computer which provides executive function to all its other systems, and nearly all possess a life support system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each system has 10 mega hit points. If a strategic attack on a system reduces it to 0 hit points, it is disabled and doesn't function until it is repaired (generally requiring the work of a trained engineer).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs to install new systems are found on the System Costs table below. Additional rules regarding installing new systems are in the Customizing your Ship section.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 231px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"236\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 147.5px;\" width=\"115\" /> <col style=\"width: 80.5px;\" width=\"121\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"height: 15.0pt; width: 86pt;\" width=\"115\" height=\"20\">\n<h2>System Costs</h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\"><em>System</em></td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\"><em>Cost</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Arcane Cannon</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">10,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Cloaking</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">16,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Communications</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Fabricator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Hypercapacitor</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">7,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Life Pods</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Life Support</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Probe</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Sensors</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Shield Generator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Shuttle</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Sickbay</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Simulator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">6,250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Teleporters</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">20,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Tractor Beam</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">10,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Umbilicus</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Arcane Cannon</h3>\n<p>This immensely sophisticated station focuses and magnifies a spellcaster&rsquo;s power, allowing them to cast spells that lay waste to entire fleets. To use an arcane cannon, you must be a spellcaster and be in the Gunner role. The cannon allows you to see ships as if you were on the bridge, which enables you to target ships with spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use the arcane cannon, you must first use your action to charge it for one round. Charging the cannon doesn't expend a spell slot, but if the cannon is not used on the next round, it discharges harmlessly and must be charged again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use your action to cast an evocation spell into the charged arcane cannon, you can choose a ship as a target instead of a creature. The spell must have a duration of Instantaneous and a range of 5 feet or greater. The GM can decide if a spell is inappropriate to be magnified by the cannon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arcane cannon transforms the spell into a mega spell; as such, this spell fails if it is cast within an area of gravitation. Its range and the dimensions of its spell effects are multiplied by 100, to a maximum range of 10,000 feet. Also, the spell deals mega damage instead of normal damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a spell cast through the arcane cannon targeting a ship calls for a saving throw, the pilot makes that saving throw on behalf of the ship itself. Abilities like Evasion don't affect this type of saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Cloaking</h3>\n<p>The engineer must use their action to activate or deactivate this system, causing the ship to become invisible or to return to visibility. This invisibility ends if your ship attacks, takes damage, moves more than 500 feet on its turn, or if anyone aboard the ship casts a spell or uses a system (such as a teleporter) that penetrates the ship&rsquo;s hull. The ship can be invisible for a total of 5 minutes each day, though this time doesn't need to be used in consecutive turns. This time recharges 24 hours after use.</p>\n<h3>Communications</h3>\n<p>For two ships to communicate, they must both have a functioning communications system and be within 1,000<br />miles of one another. This system normally transmits only audio communication, and most systems also translate it to the listener&rsquo;s language, as per the tongues spell (though older models and those in disrepair are less likely to have<br />this feature).</p>\n<h3>Fabricator</h3>\n<p>Though most ships carry rations for long journeys, many employ a magic fabricator which replicates the effects of the create food and water spell to provide a reliable source of nourishment for the entire crew. Indeed, many view this type of system as being a part of life support itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some ships use even more sophisticated replicators, capable of not only creating food and drink, but also capable of manufacturing just about anything, as per the fabricate spell. Though these more sophisticated systems are phenomenally expensive, they&rsquo;re essential for the largest of ships, which contain innumerable parts which can fail at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Any ship of Corvette size or larger with this system can be expected to have the fabricate version of this system installed.</p>\n<h3>Hypercapacitor</h3>\n<p>A hypercapacitor is an immense secondary power cell, which slowly charges itself until it contains a staggering quantity of arcane energy. The engineer can discharge the hypercapacitor in place of supplying a spell slot of 5th<br />level or lower to power a void jump or overcharge the engine. Once discharged, it takes 24 hours to charge, but a spellcaster can use their action and expend a spell slot of the same level as the Dark Matter engine&rsquo;s class to charge<br />it early. A ship can have no more than two hypercapacitors installed at one time.</p>\n<h3>Life Pods</h3>\n<p>In the event of catastrophic ship failure, life pods are the last hope for survival. A ship with this system has a single-person life pod for each crew member and passenger. At any time, you can use your action to board a life pod and eject from the ship. The pod travels far enough to clear any explosion of the ship, then drifts aimlessly. The pod has extremely minimal thrusters&mdash;enough to change direction two or three times&mdash;and enough air, power, and rations to sustain its passenger for 7 days. Each life pod automatically produces a distress signal that can be detected by any ship with sensors, though such a signal only travels at the speed of light&mdash;very slow by galactic scale. A life pod can survive reentry on most planets.</p>\n<h3>Life Support</h3>\n<p>Providing a ship with air, heat, and artificial gravity, a life support system is the most integral part of a ship for its crew. If a life support system is disabled, a temporary life support system will typically be engaged, providing the ship with air and heat for up to an hour, but not restoring artificial gravity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For less conventional starships, such as those shaped as galleons or which are built within great trees, the life support system extends a bubble of heat and atmosphere around the entire ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible to survive for some time without a functioning life support system, as long as crew members have functioning life suits, but these alternatives are frequently a temporary stop-gap while the life support is repaired.<br />A crew member with sufficient privileges with the ship computer aboard the bridge of a ship can normally disable the life support manually as an action. Depending on the ship, this may allow them to vent atmosphere from the ship, disable the artificial gravity (rendering the entire ship a zero-gravity environment, if it&rsquo;s in space), disable the ship&rsquo;s heaters, or do all of those things to all or part of the ship.</p>\n<h3>Probe</h3>\n<p>This remotely piloted drone is deployed from the ship to analyze potentially hazardous environments ahead of the ship itself. The probe has no combat capabilities but transmits everything it sees and hears back to its controller. If the probe strays more than 100 miles from the controller, it loses connection and falls dormant until the controller unit is within signal range. The statistics for a probe are included in the Example Ships section.</p>\n<h3>Sensors</h3>\n<p>The vast majority of ships are equipped with an array of sensors used to pinpoint ships and other obstacles within 100 miles. If these sensors are missing or disabled, a ship can only see and make attacks within its cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Shield Generator</h3>\n<p>A massive arcane projector, pulsing with waves of abjuration magic, a shield generator is required for a ship to have a directional shield. If it is disabled, a ship loses all of its shield points until it is repaired.</p>\n<h3>Shuttle</h3>\n<p>Like fighters, shuttles are smaller ships which can be deployed from a parent ship as an action to perform a number of operations. Whereas fighters are strictly offensive, however, shuttles aren't typically equipped with weapons, and can instead hold a more sizable crew and a larger capacity of cargo. Shuttles are usually used to ferry people and goods between the main ship and a planet&rsquo;s surface, and make for a cheap and effective alternative to teleportation. The statistics for a shuttle are included in the Example Ships section.</p>\n<h3>Sickbay</h3>\n<p>Illness and injury are bound to happen on a starship, and without a dedicated healer onboard, a sickbay is a critical facility on any starship. This system has a pool of 6 medical dice, which are d8s. Each of these dice recharge 24 hours after being used. You can spend 1 minute in a sickbay and expend one or more of these dice to cause you or another creature in the sickbay to regain hit points equal to the value rolled. Alternatively, you can expend 3 medical dice to cure yourself of any disease or poison afflicting you or another creature in the sickbay.</p>\n<h3>Simulator</h3>\n<p>Because voyages aboard a starship can last months or even years at a time, simulating the luxuries of home can be a great boon to the crew's morale. A simulator is an immensely complex room, technically a sentient magic item, that employs dozens of systems to create the effects of the spells hallucinatory terrain and major image to replicate entire environments and situations. Though this system was designed to train crew members for dangerous situations and to simulate tactical battles, it is just as often employed for entertainment purposes.</p>\n<h3>Teleporters</h3>\n<p>Blinking from the inside of a ship onto the surface of a planet is an invaluable function for many starships. As such, many ships contain a number of permanent teleportation circles specially designed for this type of short-range transportation. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can use their action to activate the teleportation system, targeting a single unmoving location within 100 miles of the ship and creating a temporary destination teleportation circle at that location. This circle lasts for 1 minute or until another teleportation circle is created. Because the resonance of a Dark Matter engine interferes with the teleportation magic, you can&rsquo;t create a destination circle inside a ship which has a functioning Dark Matter engine unless engineers on both ships coordinate the teleporters to allow transit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, a network of teleportation circles will be set up inside particularly large ships to facilitate quick navigation. Such teleporters are constantly active.</p>\n<h3>Tractor Beam</h3>\n<p>A tractor beam is a very large device designed to pull spacecraft and other objects toward the ship. If you are in the Engineer role, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack using a tractor beam. The target must be an object or ship within 3,000 feet that is less than half the size of your ship and isn't moving away from it. If you are not a spellcaster, you only add your proficiency bonus to this attack roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a hit, the target is caught in the tractor beam. At the beginning of each of your turns, you can use your action to maintain the beam and pull the target up to 500 feet closer to your ship. The target can&rsquo;t otherwise move while it is within the tractor beam.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the target is a ship, it can attempt to break free of the tractor beam. The pilot of the target ship can make a Dexterity (Piloting) check on its turn, opposed by your Intelligence (Technology) check. If you fail, the ship uses half its movement speed to escape the tractor beam and can move freely for the remainder of its movement.</p>\n<h3>Umbilicus</h3>\n<p>An umbilicus is a long, hollow cable which extends from one ship to another (a maximum of 100 feet), allowing the transport of people and goods between the two without&nbsp; compromising the hull of either ship. An umbilicus is required to board another ship.</p>\n<h2>Customizing Your Ship</h2>\n<p>As parts fail and repairs are made in the Black, most ships start to look less and less like their original factory models and more like customized Frankenstein ships, composed of parts from dozens of vessels, strapped to a vaguely familiar frame. Sometimes, these sorts of repairs are necessary to keep the ship operating, but other times, they&rsquo;re optional, made solely to upgrade the original model in desirable ways. There are four general varieties of customizations you can give a ship: upgrading a ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine, replacing weapons, adding new systems, and other general upgrades. You can install two or more upgrades at the same time, as long as you have access to a spaceport and enough people to install all the upgrades simultaneously.</p>\n<h3>Upgrading a Dark Matter Engine</h3>\n<p>Installing a new Dark Matter engine is no trivial task. The void crystals at the core of a Dark Matter engine are extremely fragile and must be in pristine condition to operate correctly. If an engine is installed incorrectly, the void crystals will likely be damaged, resulting in an immediate (or delayed) instability event, consuming the ship and all aboard it in a sphere of annihilation. Often, automatons will perform most of the testing after trained engineers have installed the crystals. Despite the risk and the cost, you can upgrade a ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine by 1 class (or install a Class 1 Dark Matter engine into a ship that didn&rsquo;t have one) with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor<br />as shown on the Dark Matter Upgrade table. Upgrading a Dark Matter engine on a ship larger than a frigate is generally impossible, as larger engines are too deeply interconnected to the ship to be replaced.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 105px; width: 228px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"236\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 167px;\" width=\"115\" /> <col style=\"width: 257px;\" width=\"121\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15px; width: 177pt;\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"236\" height=\"20\">\n<h2>Dark Matter Upgrade</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\"><em>Ship Size</em></td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\"><em>Cost</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Fighter</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Personal</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Transport</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">12,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Corvette</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">25,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Frigate</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">37,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Upgrading Weapons</h3>\n<p>The ideal ship would have dozens of weapons installed on every external surface, covering every possible direction with extreme firepower. Reality, however, gets in the way. Because each weapon needs a gunner, each external weapon is linked to a single gunner station on the inside of the ship. Unfortunately, this means most ships can&rsquo;t install additional weapons&mdash;doing so would require a complete overhaul of the ship&rsquo;s internal layout.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is relatively simple, however, to replace one ship weapon with another. Doing so requires 1 day of work and the cost of the weapon to be installed. Removed weapons can be kept in storage (though most are massively heavy and spacious) or sold at half market value.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also change the mounting location of a facing weapon with 8 hours of work, choosing for the weapon to be installed facing the front, back, left, or right of the ship.</p>\n<h3>Adding New Systems</h3>\n<p>Ships have a wide variety of systems at their disposal, expanding their capabilities and comforts, making them both powerful weapons and cozy homes. Ships have room to install three additional systems before space on board becomes a significant problem. However, fightersized ships have much tighter space, and have no room for additional systems. After the maximum number of systems are installed, new systems can only be installed by removing other systems from the ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing a shield generator on a ship that doesn't have one gives that ship 8 shield points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can install a new system with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown on the System Costs table.</p>\n<h3>Other Upgrades</h3>\n<p>Starships can be outfitted with an array of upgrades that aren&rsquo;t as modular as replacing a weapon or adding a newsystem. Each of the following upgrades can be installed on a ship once, unless otherwise specified. You can install a new system with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown in the Ship Upgrades table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 306px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"285\"

in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Afterburners</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by 500 feet if the pilot moves it in a straight line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>AI Core</strong></em>. Your ship's computer has an installed construct core that manifests a sentient shipboard artificial intelligence. This AI serves to keep the ship in running order and has some interaction with all of the ship's systems, allowing it to see and hear every part of the ship and control all of its systems. It can communicate with the ship's passengers via the ship's computer system and any built-in intercom systems on the ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AI has an Intelligence of 17, a Charisma of 14, and a Wisdom of 13. It is proficient in Technology (+5) and Data (+5). It can make Intelligence checks when any situation arises and will inform its passengers of any information it knows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, at a crew member's command, the AI can directly assume any character role aboard the ship. The AI can perform any action provided by that role, taking its turn at the end of the initiative order. The ship adds +3 to all of its attack rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI personalities can vary wildly. Some are snarky and occasionally play jokes on their crew, while others are fiercely logical and derive pleasure chiefly from calculating probabilities to dozens of decimal places. All, however, generally enjoy their hulls and decks being cleaned regularly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antivirus Module</strong></em>. Your ship has a secondary arcane terminal which screens all access to the ship computer for hacking attempts. Any attempt to hack the ship&rsquo;s computer or any system or door control has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Arcana-Resistant Coating</strong></em>. Any crew member that must make a saving throw to resist a magic effect originating from outside the ship can add +2 to the roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Assault Port</strong></em>.

Your ship comes equipped with a luxurious command chair, laden with communication controls and a single prominent red button. The captain can take one of their special actions as a bonus action, and regains the ability to do so after 24 hours. The captain can&rsquo;t take the same special action twice on the same turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have the Captain role to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Countermeasures</strong></em>. Your ship has a series of flares or a deployable decoy designed to confuse the targeting of a pursuing vessel. You can trigger your countermeasures as a reaction when you are targeted by an attack, causing that attack to have disadvantage. Once you use your countermeasures, you must load a new set in a process which takes 1 minute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must be fighter-sized to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Cruising Engines</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s sublight speed is doubled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Ded Reckoner</strong></em>.

Your ship is less likely to suffer catastrophic failure and has advantage on detonation saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Expanded Hold</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s cargo capacity increases by 50%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Expanded Quarters</strong></em>. Your ship can hold 25% more passengers (rounded up) above its normal capacity without overly taxing the life support during long voyages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>External Manipulators</strong></em>. A pair of extensible clawed arms can fold out from the hull of your ship or fold down again as an action. These arms can reach up 50 feet and can each push, pull, or grip with a maximum force of 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Internal Reinforcements</strong></em>. You have improved the integrity of your fighter by filling every hollow space with lightweight reinforcements. Your fighter&rsquo;s mega hit points increases by 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must be fighter-sized to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Jump Rift</strong></em>. When your ship makes a void jump, any ship within 500 feet of it is carried with it when it jumps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lifeform Scanner</strong></em>. You enhance your ship&rsquo;s sensors to be able to detect living creatures. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can spend 1 minute to scan a ship within 100 miles to determine the exact number of living humanoids onboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have sensors to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Live Feed</strong></em>. Your communications system provides a live video feed or holographic image of both parties. The recipient can choose whether or not to mask their image from your feed. Both parties must have a live feed to use this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have communications to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Material Analyzer</strong></em>. Your sensors have been upgraded with a directional scanner that determines a target's composition. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can spend 1 minute to scan a target within 1,000 miles, learning by percent which metals, minerals, and materials make up the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have sensors to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Medical Station</strong></em>. A complete overhaul of your ship's sickbay has made it analogous to a small hospital. Your sickbay has twice as many (12) medical dice. Additionally, you can spend 1 minute and expend 3 medical dice to remove a level of exhaustion from yourself or another creature in the sickbay, or to end one of the following conditions afflicting you or another creature in the sickbay: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a sickbay to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Overshield</strong></em>.

Your ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine has been heavily customized with a secondary arcane engine to pump energy into the core for faster, but more erratic charging times. Once the engineer has taken the Void Jump action to charge the Dark Matter engine, they can use their action on each of their subsequent turns to panic jump the Dark Matter drive, possibly jumping early. Roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, the ship jumps early.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Radio Array</strong></em>. Your ship can communicate with another ship out to a range of 10,000 miles, rather than 1,000 miles. If the receiving ship has communications but does not have this upgrade, it can receive messages, but not transmit replies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have communications to receive this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Reinforced Hull</strong></em>. Great alloyed bands are attached on the exterior of the hull, increasing your ship&rsquo;s AC by 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Repair Drones</strong></em>. A series of mechanized drones patrol the outer side of the hull, automatically sealing leaks and repairing structural damage. If your ship is below half its hit point maximum, it regains 1 mega hit point at the beginning of the initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeting Optics</strong></em>. One installed ship weapon of your choice gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and its range increases by 500 feet. You can choose this upgrade more than once, applying it to a different weapon each time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Tri-Probe</strong></em>. Instead of holding only one drone, your probe bay instead holds three. Each of these probes can be controlled independently.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a probe to receive this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Smuggler&rsquo;s Hold</strong></em>. Your ship has hidden compartments in its hold, perfect for smuggling. These compartments can hold up to 1,000 pounds (which don't count against your ship&rsquo;s cargo capacity) in objects no larger than 6 feet in any dimension.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.iCXBxw5Gxhi8tcNp"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dq06gap2egm","color":"#000000"}}}
