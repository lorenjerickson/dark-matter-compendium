following class features.</p><h3><strong>Hit Points</strong></h3></div><div><p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per channeler level<br /><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per channeler level after 1st</p></div><div><h3><strong>Proficiencies</strong></h3></div><div><p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor<br /><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br /><strong>Tools:</strong> None<br /><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution, Intelligence<br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, History, Insight, Investigation, Persuasion, and Religion</p></div><div><h3><strong>Equipment</strong></h3></div><div><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p></div><ul><li>A martial weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) any simple melee weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<em>b</em>) a scholar’s pack</li><li>Scale mail and a material component pouch</li></ul><h2><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.e3j9o2NzhhlPVE9E]{Arcane Reverberation}</strong></h2><p>At 1st level, you can sense the reverberations magic leaves inside objects. By spending your action concentrating on an object that you touch, you can make an Intelligence check to determine if the object is under the effect of magic or if it is within the area of any spells (DC equals 10 + the spell’s level). You learn the school of magic, if any. If the object is a magic item, you feel an intense amount of energy, but can’t directly determine the type of item, or its properties. If the object is a portal or a portal key, you know to which plane of existence it leads, and you learn if the portal has any special requirements, but not what these requirements are.</p><h2><strong>Planar Order</strong></h2><p>At 1st level, you align yourself with a close confederation of channelers, called a Planar Order. Your choice is linked to the kind of portal key you wield, for channelers with similar keys might use the same passageways throughout the multiverse. Your choice in planar order grants you features at 1st level, and additional features at 7th, 10th, and 15th level.</p><h3><strong>Portal Key</strong></h3><p>Each order also details the types of portal keys they use to manipulate planar energies and cast spells. With your portal key in hand, you can open certain planar portals (at the GMs discretion) without the normal portal key.<br />         If your portal key is out of your reach for longer than 1 minute, you can teleport it back to your hand as a bonus action. If your portal key is ever lost or destroyed, you can replace it by performing a 1-hour ritual, which can be done during a short rest, to imbue an object of a similar type with a portal key’s magic.</p><h2><strong>Fighting Style</strong></h2><p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h3><strong>Combat Casting</strong></h3><p>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls.</p><h3><strong>Dueling</strong></h3><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h3><strong>Hand-and-a-Half</strong></h3><p>While wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h3><strong>Magebreaker</strong></h3><p>When you deal damage to a creature with a melee weapon attack, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by that creature until the beginning of your next turn.</p><h2><strong>Spellcasting</strong></h2><p>Starting at 2nd level, by evoking your connection to the planes through your portal key, you can channel raw power from the multiverse into spells.</p><h3><strong>Arcana Points</strong></h3><p>You have a pool of arcana points, which you can use to cast spells of 1st level and higher. The Arcana Point Cost table summarizes the number of arcana points required to produce a spell slot of 1st to 5th level. Cantrips don’t require spell slots and therefore don’t require arcana points.<br />         The Channeler table shows how many arcana points you have and when your point pool increases. You regain all expended arcana points when you finish a long rest.</p><div><h4><strong>Arcana Point Cost</strong></h4></div><table><tbody><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Point Cost</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher</strong></h3><p>You know four first-level spells of your choice from the channeler spell list. The channeler table shows when you learn more channeler spells of your choice. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown on the Max Spell Level column for your level.<br />         Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the channeler spells you know and replace it with another spell from the channeler spell list, which also must be of a level no higher than what’s shown on the Max Spell Level column.</p></div><h3><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your channeler spells, since you learn your spells by studying and memorizing sigil sequences to planar gates. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a channeler spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h3><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong></h3><p>You must use your portal key as a spellcasting focus in order to use your channeler spells.</p><h3><strong>Channeler as a Half-Caster</strong></h3><p>Though the channeler class uses arcane points in place of conventional spell slots, this does not exempt it from interacting with multiclassing or other optional rules for spellcasters.<br />         Multiclassing, as well as other rules which refer to the Spellcasting feature, treat the Channeler as a Half-Caster, such as a Paladin or Ranger. If the channeler multiclasses with another spellcaster, convert the total number of spell slots of 5th level or lower from the multiclass table into arcana points using the Arcana Point Cost table. Arcana points can only be used to cast spells of 5th level and lower.</p><h2><strong>Spell Channeling</strong></h2><p>By 2nd level, you have mastered the art of channeling spells through your weapon strikes. When you make a spell attack against a creature within your reach while holding a melee weapon that isn’t heavy, you can use your bonus action to substitute the spell attack with a melee weapon attack. On a hit, the weapon attack deals normal damage, in addition to the effects of the spell.</p><h2><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.cHyT6N1uhGoBcJQr]{Planar Focus}</strong></h2><p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can narrow your focus to channel energy from a particular part of the multiverse. You can use your bonus action to begin or end a planar focus. Once on each of your turns, you can switch your active focus. You maintain this effect as if concentrating on a spell.</p><p>You have the following four focus options:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Elemental Air.</strong></em> Your movement speed increases by 10 feet, you can stand from being prone without using any movement, and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Elemental Earth.</strong></em> While you are not holding a shield, your Armor Class increases by 2.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Elemental Fire.</strong></em> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a channeler spell, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Elemental Water.</strong></em> Whenever you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage and you do not have resistance to that type of damage, you can use your reaction to halve the damage taken.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Ability Score Improvement</strong></h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2><strong>Extra Attack</strong></h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h2><strong>Combat Channeling</strong></h2><p>Starting at 5th level, when you use Spell Channeling, you can make two melee weapon attacks, instead of one. The second attack must target a different creature than the first. The effects of the spell are only triggered on the first hit.<br />         At 11th level, both melee weapon attacks can target the same creature.</p><h2><strong>Null Arcane</strong></h2><p>At 6th level, you have learned to tap into the Void between planes. When you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell of 5th level or lower, you can use your reaction to produce a field of opposing magic, nullifying the effect. You expend a number of arcana points equal to the spell’s point cost, as shown in the Arcana Point Cost table (or 1 point for a cantrip) and make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.</p><h2><strong>Greater Focus</strong></h2><p>Starting at 14th level, you gain the following Planar Focus options:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Limbo.</strong></em> Once per turn when you deal damage to a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action to sap some arcane energy from the strike. On a hit, you regain 1 arcana point, up to your arcana point maximum.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Paradise.</strong></em> You have a flight speed equal to your movement speed. When you begin your turn in the air, you can maintain this effect by spending an arcana point. Otherwise, you fall.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Underworld.</strong></em> You can cast the spell <em>vampiric touch</em> without using arcana points. You maintain concentration on this spell as long as you maintain this planar focus.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Planeshifter</strong></h2><p>Starting at 18th level, you can freely walk the planes. You can cast the <em>plane shift</em> spell once, without using arcana points or spell components.<br />         Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before using it again.</p><h3 id=\"nexus-arcane\"><strong>Nexus Arcane</strong></h3><p>At 20th level, you connect with the central nexus of all existence. When you roll initiative and have no arcana points remaining, you immediately regain 10 arcana points.</p><h1>PLANAR ORDERS</h1><p>A channeler’s first steps into the multiverse are daunting: the infinite planes of existence are treacherous and do not yield their secrets easily. To this end, channelers abroad in the multiverse rely on their planar orders for guidance, protection, and information. Even on their home planes, planar orders sometimes meet to discuss business or ensure that the plane is protected from outsiders with malicious intents.</p><div><h3><strong>Planar Orders</strong></h3></div><table><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Order of Mawstone Psions</td><td><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">The Order of Mawstone Psions believes that the 'verse is interwoven with innumerable,</span></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://magehandpress.com/2022/10/order-of-blinknights.html\">Order of Blinknights</a></td><td>Teleports around the battlefield to strike with arcane precision</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://magehandpress.com/2022/10/order-of-dimensional-magi.html\">Order of Dimensional Magi</a></td><td>Masters of ritual magic that can slip into invisibility</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://magehandpress.com/2022/10/order-of-titanfists.html\">Order of Titanfists</a></td><td>Wields a battlefist to crush their foes under colossal strikes</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://magehandpress.com/2022/10/order-of-wild-hunters.html\">Order of Wild Hunters</a></td><td>Channels spells into arrows to deliver melee spells at range</td></tr></tbody></table><div><h1>CHANNELER SPELLS</h1></div><p>Masters of planar arcana and keepers of dimensional secrets, channelers possess a handful of unique spells not known to other spellcasters.

This theory brings them a sense of understanding to these dangerous galactic phenomena, and imparts a sense of control and comfort to those who would otherwise despair in the face of such a terrible, destructive force of nature.<br>      However, the small group of warlocks who draw their power from these black holes know better: The Singularity is intelligent, malevolent, and, above all, hungry.</p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>The Singularity gives you the power to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.</li>\n<li>Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.</li>\n<li>You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can’t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.</li>\n<li>When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.</li>\n<li>Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Dark Matter pg. 59","quantity":1,"weight":20,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"bonus","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":null,"type":"heavy","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"attuned":false},"ownership":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1669756035649,"modifiedTime":1669756037792,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"6VnXmAgcYFhncpxS"}

When you prepare spells following a long rest, you use your mechanist's tools and spend spell slots to raise a collection of mundane parts into mechanical constructs. Once you have expended a spell slot to make a construct, you can't regain that slot until the construct is disassembled (requiring 10 minutes of work) or drops to 0 hit points. Different constructs cost different number of spell slot levels and can only be created when you have enough levels in this class, as shown on the Constructs table above.

You can have up to 3 constructs at one time.<br>     When you take a long rest, you can repair your constructs to their full hit points.

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any of your constructs within 60 feet of you, issuing a command to each one. You can decide what action the construct will take and where it will move. If you command your constructs to attack, each construct makes only one attack. Alternatively, you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>At 8th level, you learn a fourth cantrip from this list.</p><h3>Bonus Focus</h3><p>At 7th level, you gain the following Planar Focus option:</p><p><em><strong>Ethereal</strong></em>. You can use your bonus action and spend up to 3 arcana points to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see up to 15 feet away for each arcana point spent.</p><h3>Spellstrike Ward</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your bonus action to raise a defensive ward. For the next minute, you have a pool of 5 temporary hit points. For the duration, whenever you deal damage to a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack, your temporary hit point pool gains points equal to your Intelligence modifier. Your hit point pool holds a maximum number of points equal to twice your level.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.</p><h3>Arcane Edge</h3><p>At 15th level, when you hit with a spell attack roll that is channeled through a melee weapon attack, you can choose for the attack to become a critical hit.

Because you share in the beast's ferocity, tenacity, and animal instinct, you can summon a beast’s primal strength from within yourself, and slay your enemies in an animalistic trance.<br />     While entranced, you can sense a connection to a greater being, the Primal Beast, the first predator, from which all hunters are descended. As your commitment to defending the wilds from corruption grows, you grow closer to the Primal Beast, until you can at last adopt its ancient form yourself, and allow it to hunt once again.</p>\n<h3>Feral Trance</h3>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can fall into a primal battle trance as a bonus action. While in your trance, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t holding a shield or wearing heavy armor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\n<li>Your base movement speed increases by 10 feet.</li>\n<li>Once per turn, when you make an attack roll against a creature, you can end your current mark, and mark that creature instead.</li>\n<li>When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your trance lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your trance on your turn as a bonus action.<br />     Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Predator’s Scent</h3>\n<p>By 6th level, you hunt like an animal. A creature you have marked remains marked for 24 hours, even if it moves out of your sight and further than 30 feet away. You gain no damage bonus against the creature while it is out of range, but you can track it effortlessly. While this creature is marked, you know the direction of, but not the distance to, the creature.</p>\n<h3>Evasion</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 13th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or anice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n<h3>Form of the Primal Beast</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, as an action, you can transform into a hunched thing of fur and shadow, an echo of the Primal Beast. For 1 minute, you gain the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain all the benefits of Feral Trance.</li>\n<li>You gain temporary HP equal to twice your level.</li>\n<li>Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d8 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a Constitution saving throw (save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier), ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MFoV","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Warden","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"critRange":{"type":"String","value":null},"critDamage":{"type":"String","value":""},"quickDesc":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickAttack":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickSave":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickDamage":{"type":"Array","value":[],"altValue":[],"context":[]},"quickProperties":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickCharges":{"type":"Boolean","value":{"use":true,"resource":true,"charge":false},"altValue":{"use":true,"resource":true,"charge":false}},"quickTemplate":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickOther":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true,"context":""},"quickFlavor":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickPrompt":{"type":"Boolean","value":false,"altValue":false}},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.wg9zojGd5GfroIWe"},"cf":{"id":"temp_42s6nxb7sfr","color":"#000000"}}}

Many wild hunters chase quarry for clients, but many more simply do it for the challenge and thrill of the hunt itself. Only wild hunters know the secret for shrinking a spell onto an arrow’s point, but this skill alone marks them among the most dangerous warriors in existence. Truly, there is no covering your tracks or escaping anywhere in the planes from a wild hunter.</p><h3>Portal Key: Quiver</h3><p>At 1st level, your portal key is a quiver which produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition. Whenever a piece of ammunition is taken from the quiver, it is instantly replaced by a similar piece of ammunition. A piece of ammunition removed from the quiver disintegrates after 1 minute.</p><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use ammunition taken from this quiver to channel spells at range. When you make a ranged spell attack against a creature, you can use your bonus action to substitute the spell attack with a ranged weapon attack using ammunition taken from your portal key quiver. On a hit, the attack deals the weapon’s normal damage die, but not its ability score modifier, in addition to the effects of the spell.</p><p>When your spell channeling improves at higher levels, you can similarly use your quiver to channel spells at range.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>At 1st level, you learn three cantrips of your choice from the following list: chill touch, fire bolt, light, mage hand, mending, minor illusion, prestidigitation, produce flame, ray of frost, and resistance. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>At 8th level, you learn a fourth cantrip from this list.</p><h3>Bonus Focus</h3><p>At 7th level, you gain the following Planar Focus option:</p><p><em><strong>Asphodel</strong></em>. When you miss with a ranged weapon attack on your turn, you can spend an arcana point to repeat the attack against the same target. You can use this ability once per turn.</p><h3>Fey Arrowhead</h3><p>By 10th level, you’ve mastered a trick known to fey hunters for moving swiftly through the underbrush. Once per turn, when you make a ranged attack using your portal key quiver, you can spend 2 arcana points to replace the attack with a Fey Arrowhead. You teleport to where the projectile lands, or to the nearest unoccupied space.</p><h3>Arrow Downpour</h3><p>At 15th level, you can single-handedly deliver a rain of arrows upon your foes. As an action, you can fire the ammunition from your quiver in a high arc, affecting a 100-foot long, 15-foot wide line. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature with cover from above has advantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 + 10 piercing damage, or half as much on a successful save.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MHP Channeler","identifier":"order-of-mawstone-psions","classIdentifier":"channeler","advancement":[{"_id":"Rh3BYQKRWco3i3ll","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":3},"8":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known","icon":""},{"_id":"SZWA1vCD1f2FSCZB","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.Dzn6oRTKEnOJYzoK"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Key","icon":""},{"_id":"jTb9ZbK9RfEAQpi5","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.FXBrNUhJngcCRgKz"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"Bonus Focus","icon":""},{"_id":"jqbSXHqyspmPsqkB","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.MpGgyRZnYMtWabsw"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Kinetic","icon":""},{"_id":"IvF0gojZxTe9r2nc","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.cyOLM0u8GHwIOm3c"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":15,"title":"GM","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.DgBEBmCu8DLAsuAq"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ptpm72g0lse"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1669137644731,"modifiedTime":1669577649978,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"UNs1aaW65wJDIV0j"}

Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><p><em><strong>Akimbo. </strong></em>When you engage in two-weapon fighting with firearms, you do not take a penalty to the damage of the second attack.</p><p><em><strong>Bullseye. </strong></em>You gain a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls you make using firearms. The weapon must have the Sighted property or have a normal range of 80 feet or longer to gain this effect. This effect does not stack with the Archery fighting style.</p><p><em><strong>Duelist. </strong></em>While you are wielding a firearm in one hand and nothing in the other, if you make a ranged weapon attack and exceed the target's AC by 5 or more, you deal an additional die of weapon damage. You can only use this ability once per round.</p><p><em><strong>Shotgunner. </strong></em>When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a firearm that has the Scatter property, you can reroll the lowest damage die, and you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is worse than the original.</p><h2>Quick Draw</h2><p>Gunslingers have twitch reflexes and can pull a gun in the blink of an eye. You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, you can draw or stow up to two weapons when you roll initiative and whenever you take an action on your turn.</p><p>Critical Shot</p><p>At 2nd level, your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.<br />Starting at 9th level, your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18 to 20, and at 17th your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 17 to 20.</p><p>Poker Face</p><p>Starting at 2nd level, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to prevent others from sensing your motives, perceiving your emotions, or reading your thoughts.</p><p>Risk</p><p>By 2nd level, you can perform incredible feats of daring that are fueled by special dice called risk dice.</p><p><em><strong>Risk Dice. </strong></em>You have four risk dice, which are d8s. You gain additional risk dice, and your risk dice change as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Risk Dice column of the Gunslinger table. You regain all expended risk dice when you take a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Using Risk Dice. </strong></em>Once on each of your turns, you can expend a risk die to perform a Deed of your choice. Your deed options are detailed at the end of the class description.</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws. </strong></em>Some of your deeds require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deed’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p>Deed save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p><h3>Gunslinger’s Creed</h3><p>By the time gunslingers reach 3rd level, they embrace a way of living, known as their creed, which guides their judgments and their unique brand of gunslinging. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h3>Gut Shot</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you score a critical hit on a Large or smaller creature using a firearm, the target of that attack is incapacitated until the beginning of your next turn. Elementals, oozes, and undead are immune to this effect.</p><h3>Evasion</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3>Mankiller</h3><p>At 11th level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can add your ability score modifier to firearm damage rolls.</p><h3>Dire Gambit</h3><p>Starting at 13th level, whenever you score a critical hit, you regain one expended risk die.</p><h3>Cheat Death</h3><p>By 15th level, you have a knack for escaping the reaper. When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and expend one risk die to avoid being incapacitated and instead be reduced to a number of hit points equal to the number rolled on the die.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.</p><h3>Maverick</h3><p>By 18th level, you are unshakable. You have advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws.</p><h3>Head Shot</h3><p>At 20th level, when you score a critical hit against a creature using a firearm, you can choose for this shot to be a head shot. If the creature has less than 100 hit points, it dies. Otherwise, it takes 10d10 additional damage. Elementals, oozes, undead, and creatures which lack nervous systems or vital organs take no additional damage from this ability.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.</p><hr /><h1>Deeds</h1><img style=\"float:left\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/gunslinger-gun.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"113\" /><p>These deeds are listed in alphabetical order.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.lECKrOko0g7ZCA1q]{Deed: Bite the Bullet}</strong></p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one risk die to gain temporary hit points equal the number rolled on the die + your Constitution modifier.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.UN7WnIQOJSJ05aJI]{Deed: Covering Fire}</strong></p><p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one risk die as a bonus action to cow the creature.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.jGvDnFN2QgFY1i0E]{Deed: Skin of Your Teeth}</strong></p><p>When an attacker you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can expend a risk die as a reaction to dodge out of harm’s way at the last second. You add the risk die to your AC against this attack, potentially causing it to miss.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.lw5mWdn15TQ1O2lG]{Deed: Steady Aim}</strong></p><p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one risk die to double the normal and maximum range for the next ranged weapon attack you make.</p><h1>Eras</h1><p>Gunslingers are inseparably connected to their eras, as the implements of their trade have evolved throughout history and will continue to evolve into the far future. Whereas the earliest gunslingers used muskets and black powder, space-faring gunslingers fire high-tech blasters that never run low on ammunition. Both are gunslingers, equally brash and singularly dangerous.</p><p>In general terms, gunslingers can be organized into the following eras:</p><h2>Renaissance</h2><p>Renaissance-era firearms are the gun's first steps away from heavy cannons and into portable rifles. Weapons from this era use musket balls and loose black powder, and therefore are slow to reload and more prone to malfunction. Consequently, Renaissance-era gunslingers will be skilled in swords and cannons in addition to guns, making them a fearsome foe, no matter the theater.</p><p>Such gunslingers are known to take to the sea in pirate vessels, participate in swashbuckling escapades in well-fortified castles, and engage in pistol duels for their honor, but few simply line up with their fellows and exchange musket fire.</p><p><em><strong>Variant Deeds. </strong></em>With the GM’s permission, you can pick the following two Deeds in place of two of your normal Deeds, if you are in a setting that primarily uses Renaissance firearms.</p><h3>Grazing Shot</h3><p>When you make a ranged attack against a target within the weapon's normal range and miss, you can spend a risk die as a reaction and deal damage to the target equal to the roll on the die. This ability deals no damage if the attack roll misses the target's AC by 10 or more.</p><h3>Reposition</h3><p>As a reaction when a hostile creature within 30 feet from you moves, you can expend a risk die to move up to your movement speed.</p><h2>Industrial Age</h2><p>In the Industrial Age (while the West was still being won), cartridged bullets and lever-action firearms accelerated the tempo of combat, even introducing the first automatic weapons. These guns lacked the clean assembly-line consistency of modern firearms, but laid down the bedrock for designs that have not changed much since: a classic six-shot revolver is as timeless as it is effective.</p><p>Gunslingers in the Industrial Age fought in legendarily bloody wars, trailblazed the frontier, formed gangs to rob trains by horseback, and had shootouts in saloons.</p><p><em><strong>Variant Deeds. </strong></em>With the GM’s permission, you can pick the following two Deeds in place of two of your normal Deeds, if you are in a setting that primarily uses Industrial Age firearms.</p><h3>Fancy Gunplay</h3><p>You can impressively twirl your weapons to impress others. Whenever you make a Charisma (Performance) check or a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using one of your ranged weapons, you can expend a risk die and add it to the ability check.</p><h3>Maverick Spirit</h3><p>As a reaction when you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can expend one risk die and add it to saving throw.</p><h2>Modern</h2><p>Modern firearms have embraced automatic fire, ammunition magazines, and lighter caliber bullets (which can travel at much higher speeds.) For these guns, form begets function: weapons are designed for a specific role, such as sniper rifles for long range and shotguns for close quarters, and every aspect of their design supports this role. Moreover, weapons that enjoyed success in the West, such as the double-barrel shotgun, can still be found in use today.</p><p>Modern gunslingers can be gangsters wielding twin machine pistols, modern soldiers with assault rifles, assassins that prefer to snipe their targets from a safe distance, or covert spies, infiltrating a building with a pistol hidden in a phone.</p><p><em><strong>Variant Deeds. </strong></em>With the GM’s permission, you can pick the following two Deeds in place of two of your normal Deeds, if you are in a setting that primarily uses Modern firearms.</p><h3>Curved Trajectory</h3><p>When you make an attack with a ranged weapon against a target within the weapon's normal range, you can expend a risk die to ignore half and three-quarters cover.</p><h3>Take the Bullet</h3><p>As a reaction when a creature within 15 feet of you is targeted by a ranged attack, you can spend a risk die to dive in the way of the bullet. You move next to the creature and become the target of the attack. If you are hit, you can subtract the risk die from the damage taken.</p><h2>Futuristic</h2><p>Firearms of the future have only tenuous connections to the weapons of the past. Though they still retain the profile of handguns, shotguns, and assault rifles, futuristic firearms are powered by rechargeable arcane batteries (or power cells) and produce bursts of pure energy, instead of bullets. Generally, these weapons are referred to as blasters and, while they never need to be reloaded, tend to be more expensive and more finicky than modern firearms. Blasters, for example, can overheat, and will require a cooldown period before being used again.</p><p>Future gunslingers will jet across the galaxy, with blaster in hand and a song in their hearts. Others, however, will see the potential of blasters as cutting-edge technology and will attempt to optimize them to their limits.</p><p><em><strong>Variant Deeds. </strong></em>With the GM’s permission, you can pick the following two Deeds in place of two of your normal Deeds, if you are in a setting that primarily uses Futuristic firearms.</p><h3>Blindfire</h3><p>While you are in total cover, you can expend a risk die as a bonus action to make one ranged weapon attack with disadvantage against any target within the weapon's range.</p><h3>Disguised Shot</h3><p>Once per turn when you make a ranged weapon attack, you can spend a risk die to hide the source of the attack. Though this does not silence the attack, it does obscure other markers of the attack, such as muzzle flare, which might implicate you as the attacker. Make a Charisma (Deception) check and add the risk die to the roll, opposed by the highest passive Perception score of the spectators. On a success, no spectator to the attack can identify its source.</p><h2>Suggested Era</h2><p>Though some weapons can exist in any era (especially if the story demands an exotic firearm enter the fray), many are best suited to their own era. Gunslingers, too, will seem out of place if in the wrong era; a musketeer will probably not spend their holidays on their spaceship going to Mars, for example. The following table provides a suggested list of firearms and gunslingers for different eras and recommends different names for firearms that would otherwise seem out of place.</p><hr /><table style=\"width:99.1655%\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:11.8187%\">Eras</td><td style=\"width:33.609%\">Archtypes</td><td style=\"width:53.7307%\">Firearms</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:11.8187%\">Renaissance</td><td style=\"width:33.609%\">Janissary, Musketeer, Sharpshooter</td><td style=\"width:53.7307%\">Blunderbuss, Flintlock, Harpoon Gun, Musket</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:11.8187%\">Industrial Age</td><td style=\"width:33.609%\">Gun Tank, Gun-Ko Master, Gundead, Lucky Son of a Gun, Pistolero, Sharpshooter, Spellslinger, Trick Shot, Twice-Damned</td><td style=\"width:53.7307%\">Double Barrel Shotgun, Gatling Gun, Handgun (Light Revolver), Hunting Rifle, Light Cannon, Magnum, Parlor Gun, Pump Shotgun (Lever-Action Shotgun) Revolver, Sawed-Off Shotgun, Sniper Rifle (Infantry Rifle)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:11.8187%\">Modern</td><td style=\"width:33.609%\">Covert Operative, Gun Tank, Gun-Ko Master, Grenadier, Lucky Son of a Gun, Pistolero, Sharpshooter, Spellslinger, Storm Gunner, Trick Shot, Twice-Damned</td><td style=\"width:53.7307%\">Assault Rifle, Double-Barrel Shotgun, Handgun, Hunting Rifle, Gatling Gun (Minigun), Grenade Launcher, Light Machine Gun, Machine Pistol, Magnum, Parlor Gun (Pocket Pistol), Pump Shotgun, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, Sawed-Off Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Submachine Gun</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:11.8187%\">Futuristic</td><td style=\"width:33.609%\">Covert Operative, Gun Tank, Laserist, Sharpshooter, Space Cowboy, Spellslinger</td><td style=\"width:53.7307%\">Blitz Cannon, Concussion Rifle, Diode Beam, Impactor Cannon, Ion Cannon, Magnus, Phaser, REC Gun, Repeater, Rocket Launcher (Devastator Missile), Standard Carbine, Singularity Emitter, Swarm Pistol</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Mage Hand Press","identifier":"","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[],"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","ath","dec","ins","itm","prc","per","pil","slt","tec"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""},"subclass":""},"ownership":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1669154589707,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"}}

The book begins inscribed with two 1st-level spells of your choice that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list. Spells copied into this spellbook don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your spellbook in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast any channeler spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.</p><p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your spellbook. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell is of level which you can cast and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>At 1st level, you learn three cantrips of your choice from the following list: acid splash, chill touch, force dart, light, mage hand, mending, message, minor illusion, poison spray, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and resistance. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>At 8th level, you learn a fourth cantrip from this list.</p><h3>Bonus Focus</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you gain the following Planar Focus option:</p><p><em><strong>Shadowfell</strong></em>. On your turn, you can use your bonus action and spend 2 arcana points to become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, and can spend an additional arcana point at the start of your turn to maintain this effect for an additional round.

For the next minute, you can subtract your Intelligence modifier from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take. This effect is bypassed by damage that would normally affect creatures on the Ethereal Plane.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Secret Arcana</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, you know three spells of your choice of 7th level or lower from the wizard spell list.

When it manifests, it does so as a simple geometric projection; otherwise, it is merely a voice in your ear, checking your reasoning and informing you of relevant information. Your companion can solve any arithmetic or strictly logical problem you pose to it.<br />     Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, you can treat the result as 10, or your gadgeteer level + your Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.<br />     Your AI companion downloads and integrates knowledge of additional subjects as you gain higher levels in this class. At 6th level, and again at 10th level and 15th level, you can choose one of the following skills to gain this benefit when you make an Intelligence check with it: Arcana, Data, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.</p><h2>Gadgets</h2><p>At 1st level, you begin to amass a collection of cutting-edge technological devices called @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.W1krWt5lb2AGGOE1]{gadgets}. You gain one gadget of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Because your gadgets are powered by your personal power cell, no other creature can use them. If one of your gadgets is lost or damaged, you can fashion a new one for no cost when you take a long rest.<br />     You acquire additional gadgets as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Gadgeteer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you have and replace it with another one that you could gain at that level.<br />     Your gadget options are detailed at the end of the class description.<br />     <em><strong>Saving Throws. </strong></em>If one of your gadgets calls for a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:</p><p>     <strong>Gadget save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.UiLBFkuThEn1mZd7]{Overcharge}</h2><p>With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional die of damage to that target.<br />     This ability improves as you gain levels in this class. You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice), 11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally, starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the blaster’s damage roll.</p><h2>Prototype</h2><p>At 2nd level, you make a breakthrough innovation with a prototype of your own design. Choose one of the following three prototypes.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.6VnXmAgcYFhncpxS]{Experimental Frame}</h3><p>You have developed a sophisticated experimental frame, a powerful exo-suit that augments your strength and shelters you from harm. Your experimental frame counts as heavy armor, which you can don or doff as a bonus action, and it also grants you the benefits of a life suit. You are proficient with your experimental frame, but no other creature can wear it. While wearing your frame, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your size becomes Medium, if it is smaller.</li><li>Your movement speed increases to 30 feet, if it is less.</li><li>Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.</li><li>Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.</li><li>You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can’t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.</li><li>When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.</li><li>Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.</li></ul><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.monsters.gcv0riOmF3lR0gvw]{Mechanized Autonomous Construct (M.A.C.)}</h3><p>You have put the finishing touches on a Mechanized Autonomous Construct (a MAC), which is a specially-constructed automaton piloted by your AI.<br />     The construct has statistics as shown on the character sheet, and takes its own turn in combat immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command your construct if it is within 500 feet of you (no action required). You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. In combat, your construct's actions are governed by its Combat Protocols, which you can switch as a bonus action on your turn. If you are incapacitated or absent, your AI guides your construct to protect you and itself.<br />     If your construct drops to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled. When you take a long rest, you can repair your construct to its full hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to build and repair your construct.<br />     You can integrate weapons and gadgets directly into your construct. You can integrate one two-handed melee weapon, two one-handed melee weapons, or a one-handed melee weapon and a gadget. When your construct draws an integrated weapon or gadget, the item snaps to its hand and it can’t be disarmed of it. Your construct is proficient with any weapons integrated into it. The construct takes the Use an Object action to activate an integrated gadget.<br />     Starting at 5th level, your construct makes two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action with its integrated weapons.</p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.2Sb90u0c0wR4pRUK]{Utility Matrix}</h3><p>You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cube-shaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of the following gadgets, which you can use at will:<br />     <em><strong>Cloaking Device. </strong></em>As an action, you can activate your cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.<br />     <em><strong>Flashbang. </strong></em>As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.<br />     <em><strong>Forcefield Projector. </strong></em>As a bonus action, you can activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.<br />     <em><strong>Grappling Hook. </strong></em>As a reaction when you fall, or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a grappling hook at a target location you can see within your movement speed. If the target location can hold your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.<br />     <em><strong>Modular Gadget. </strong></em>Starting at 5th level, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget of your choice that does not have prerequisites. This gadget doesn't count against your total number of gadgets known. Alternately, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an upgrade for an existing gadget for which you meet prerequisites. Once you reconfigure your utility matrix, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Tech Specialty (Subclass)</h2><p>Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a tech specialty that informs your gadgeteering expertise. Choose one Tech Specialty option. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.8rborYdIHEY0hIyX]{Bluescreen Protocol}</h2><p>Beginning at 7th level, you have integrated a complex construct-disabling algorithm into your AI companion, which you can activate as an action. Each construct within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your Gadget save DC. On a failed save, a construct is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated.<br />     Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.75uNnu0Xb4RYTSGp]{Override Protocol}</h2><p>At 18th level, your AI companion can upload a devastating virus to seize control of a construct. You can use your action to touch a construct within your reach, which must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Gadget save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, even if it would otherwise be immune to being charmed. While it is charmed, you can issue commands to the construct while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the construct completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.<br />     Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Dark Matter ch. 3","identifier":"","levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[],"saves":[],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["arc","dat","dec","his","inv","med","nat","pil","rel","slt","tec"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1669756824336,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"}}

For example, the hideous lights emanating from the Void, typically called radiation, normally offer a cruel, agonizing death to those who see them, but can sometimes fundamentally alter those subjected to its strange energies. This process is called \"the warp\", and those who survive it are deemed “radiation freaks” or “warped ones” for the horrible physical deformities that accompany their transformation. However, some are changed in even stranger ways. Radiation has the potential to alter a creature at the magical level as well, resulting in mutated sorcerers wielding horrific power.</p><h3>Radioactive</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, your body is saturated with harmful residual radiation. You can use your action to activate or suppress a radioactive aura. While active, your body glows with a bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Additionally, each creature which comes within 5 feet of you or starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage. At 6th level, this damage increases to 1d8, and at 14th level, this damage increases to 1d10.</p><h3>High Power</h3><p>At 1st level, whenever you deal cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, you can replace the damage type with radiant damage.</p><h3>Adaptive Resistance</h3><p>By 6th level, the tumors within your body can rapidly shift your magical metabolism. After you take damage, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type until you take a short or long rest, or until you use this ability again. You do not gain resistance against the damage that triggers this ability.</p><h3>Glow Cloud</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to transform your entire body, along with everything you’re wearing and carrying, into a cloud of dangerous radioactive material. This effect acts as the gaseous form spell, with the following differences:</p><ul><li>Your flying speed is equal to half your movement speed.</li><li>If another creature enters your space or starts its turn there, it takes 4d10 radiant damage.</li><li>You can cast cantrips while you’re in this form.</li></ul><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Isotope Poisoning</h3><p>At 18th level, as an action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to bombard a creature you touch with a near lethal amount of radioactivity. At the beginning of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the beginning of its next turn and takes 4d10 radiant damage. If a target fails three times, it remains poisoned for one hour, and takes 1d10 radiant damage at the beginning of each of its turns. If it succeeds three times, this effect ends.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Dark Matter pg. 95","identifier":"radiation-freak","classIdentifier":"sorcerer","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"O6whcBaQIegOr7mL":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.XyQHAnIMKXLnSp25"},"cf":{"id":"temp_qsjt45qd4nl"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675962347821,"modifiedTime":1675963226866,"lastModifiedBy":"O6whcBaQIegOr7mL"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"e74oPJPE1D3PGpcT"}

Starting at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to any skill check made to identify herbs, potions, poisons, or other alchemical substances. If you are proficient with such a skill, this bonus stacks with your normal proficiency bonus.</p><h2>Bombs</h2><p>At 1st level, you can create volatile alchemical bombs using your alchemist’s supplies. Whenever you take a short or long rest, you can create a number of bombs equal to 10 plus twice your alchemist level. The cost of materials necessary to create these bombs is negligible. The statistics of a bomb are shown in the Bomb sidebar. After 24 hours, an unused bomb becomes inert.</p><p>Instead of making an attack with a bomb using the Attack action, once per turn you can take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb with explosive reagents and throw it, increasing the bomb’s explosive potential and allowing you to deal additional damage. When you do so, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, to the bomb’s damage roll. Additionally, when you throw a bomb in this way, its damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p><p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>. When your bombs call for a saving throw, its save DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><strong>Bomb save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h2>Bomb Formulae</h2><p>By 2nd level, your research has granted you insight into new alchemical formulations for your bombs. Select three bomb formulae from the Bomb Formulae section below. Once per turn, when you take the Use an Object action to throw a bomb, you can apply a formula to it.</p><p>When you gain certain levels in this class, you learn additional formulae of your choice, as shown in the Bomb Formulae Known column of the Alchemist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the formulae you know and replace it with another formula.</p><h2>Field of Study</h2><p>While all alchemists share a common knowledge base, most alchemists specialize into a particular field of study. When you reach 2nd level, you select your field of study, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 18th level.</p><p>A formula granted by your field of study does not count against the total number of formulae you know.</p><h2>Reagent</h2><p>Starting at 3rd level, you have a collection of powerful alchemical reagents, represented by a pool of reagent dice, that you can spend to brew potions or magnify the power of your explosives.</p><h3>Reagent Dice</h3><p>You start with three reagent dice, which are d10s, and you gain additional reagent dice as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Reagent Dice column of the Alchemist table. You regain all expended reagent dice when you finish a long rest.</p><p>When you take the Use an Object action to prime and throw a bomb, you can expend a number of reagent dice up to your proficiency modifier and add the dice to the bomb’s damage roll.</p><h3>Brewing Potions</h3><p>You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of reagent dice to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls for a saving throw, it uses your bomb save DC.</p><p>The number of reagent dice and the alchemist level required to brew a potion are given on the Potions table:</p><table style=\"width:500px\"><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Potions</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Potion</td><td>Cost</td><td>Alchemist Level</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alchemical Anesthetic</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Climbing</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Growth</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Healing</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Water Breathing</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>Cure-All</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Greater Healing</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Heroism</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Resistance</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Diminution</td><td>3 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Flying</td><td>reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Hill Giant Strength</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Invisibility</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Superior Healing</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Reagent Synthesis</h3><p>Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain all of your expended reagent dice that you have not used to brew potions.</p><h2>Discoveries</h2><p>In the course of your research, you have made a number of discoveries regarding the nature of alchemy. At 4th level, you gain two discoveries of your choice. When you gain certain alchemist levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries Known column of the Alchemist table.</p><p>Additionally, when you learn a new discovery, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Alternatively, as an alchemist, when you gain an ability score improvement, you can instead choose to learn a new Discovery for which you meet the prerequisites.</p><h2>Flashbang</h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you carry a supply of concussive explosives which help you escape from perilous situations. As a bonus action, you can throw one of these explosives at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p><h2>Evasion</h2><p>Beginning at 11th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h2>Blast Coating</h2><p>Starting at 15th level, you automatically succeed on saving throws against your own bombs and never take damage from them.</p><h2>Philosopher’s Stone</h2><p>At 20th level, you unlock the crowning achievement of all alchemy: a philosopher’s stone, a dynamo of alchemical energy in a fist-sized glowing jewel. You can construct your philosopher’s stone using your alchemist supplies, 1,000 gp worth of materials, and 1 week of work. You can only have one philosopher’s stone at a time and only you can gain the stone’s benefits. As long as you possess the stone, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain all expended reagent dice.</p></li><li><p>Using the stone’s transmutation magic, you can brew potions as an action, instead of in 10 minutes.</p></li><li><p>You age 10 times slower than normal, and your age cannot be magically changed.</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, you learn the following formula, which doesn’t count against the total number of formulae you know:</p><h3>Nuclear Bomb</h3><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with your philosopher’s stone, you can change it into a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb deals 10d10 + 100 force damage instead of its normal fire damage, has a blast radius of 1 mile, and completely destroys the philosopher’s stone. Additionally, each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw takes full damage, instead of half damage, and each creature that succeeds its saving throw takes half damage, instead of no damage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Mage Hand Press","identifier":"alchemist","levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"Ga7vW1S6GOai5ryt","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"KxTrqjKquOJ7qs12","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.qmfrV1nNi3065s5N","Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.tRq2QjaZVHv4hIzc"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":1},{"_id":"KWvihdqZMdmTtw83","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"discoveries","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"4":{"value":2},"6":{"value":3},"9":{"value":4},"13":{"value":5},"17":{"value":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Discoveries Known","icon":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/icons/black/read.svg","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"1C29wRzasZLkfyMB","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"3":{"n":null,"die":10},"20":{"n":20,"die":10}}},"value":{},"title":"Reagent Die","icon":"icons/dice/d10black.svg","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"W5kxGm5FJgJxPbvX","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.If8fmnBOlm56RomL","Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.0nCnHUEupiUELHtW"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"y4lTkjcvcUyTh6LZ","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"formulae","type":"string","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"value":"3"},"5":{"value":"4"},"7":{"value":"5"},"9":{"value":"6"},"11":{"value":"7"},"13":{"value":"8"},"15":{"value":"9"},"17":{"value":"10"}}},"value":{},"title":"Formulae Known","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"IejbHuvNd2tapo8r","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.classes.x012jrdNbEhQMfSA"],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Grant Items","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["arc","his","ins","med","nat","prc","slt","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.tMuSfnxXTUZw0Wf5"},"cf":{"id":"temp_9cds7rx71oj"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668723953165,"modifiedTime":1672861482245,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"kpIGyM1wx09wHE78"}

However, if you channel its energy for too long, it will consume your mortal body. You can use your bonus action to enter a Nova. When you enter a Nova, and each subsequent turn you begin while your Nova is active, you take special radiant damage called Nova damage. This damage begins at 1d6 when you enter your Nova, and increases to 2d6 the following turn, 3d6 the turn after, and so on. This damage can’t be reduced or avoided. You don't make Constitution saving throws to maintain your concentration as a result of taking this damage. Your Nova ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you use your bonus action to end it.<br>     While your Nova is active, you can add bonus d6s of damage, up to a maximum of twice the number of Nova damage dice you have taken on your turn, when you damage a creature with an attack on your turn. You can choose to add all the damage dice to the roll of a single attack, or divide up the damage among multiple attacks. For example, if you take 3d6 Nova damage, you have 6d6 bonus damage to add to your attacks on your turn.</p><h3>Solar Flare</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, if you drop to 0 hit points while your Nova is active, you can choose to instead drop to 1 hit point and cause each hostile creature within 30 feet of you to take radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level. Your Nova ends.<br>    Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Healing Rays</h3><p>At 10th level, the Star’s soothing rays can mend even your severest of wounds. When you begin your turn in direct sunlight and your Nova isn't active, you can use your action to regain 1d6 hit points.<br>     You can heal yourself a number of times using this ability equal to your Charisma modifier and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. At 14th level, this healing increases to 1d10.</p><h3>Supernova</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, when you enter a Nova, you can choose for your Nova damage dice and the additional damage you deal to other creatures to be d10s, instead of d6s.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Dark Matter pg. 98","identifier":"the-star","classIdentifier":"warlock","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"O6whcBaQIegOr7mL":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.4AhvuL18dcM0sUfx"},"cf":{"id":"temp_4iuh8w5726o"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675963388273,"modifiedTime":1675963671675,"lastModifiedBy":"O6whcBaQIegOr7mL"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"lKUAUKigvfpRgspo"}

{"name":"Circle of Configuration","type":"subclass","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-oak.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p><span dir=\"ltr\">Some life is made of wire and steel, rather than flesh and bone. Druids who find credence in this notion join the Circle of Configuration and shun all ties to nature, aligning themselves instead with constructs and machines. Some do this because construct forms offer superior strength and adaptability compared to that of beasts. Others, however, believe that constructs represent a higher form of life, for constructs are ageless, designed with a clear intent, and are made to be free of hunger, thirst, and disease.</span></p><h3><span dir=\"ltr\">Machine Code</span></h3><p><span dir=\"ltr\">Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to speak the native code-language of machines. You can use this language to interact with arcane terminals and ship computers from range and to communicate with constructs, even if you don't share a language.</span></p><h3><span dir=\"ltr\">Construct Form</span></h3><p><span dir=\"ltr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than an action. However, you lose the ability to assume the shape of a beast. Instead, you can use it to take a Construct Form.<br />     While in your Construct Form, you can use your bonus action to switch into a Configuration or to switch your current Configuration into another one. You have the following Configuration options:</span></p><p><span dir=\"ltr\">     <em><strong>Juggernaut Configuration. </strong></em>Your Armor Class increases by 2. Whenever you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can subtract 2 from the damage taken. Additionally, your Photon Cannon is replaced by the following:</span></p><p><span dir=\"ltr\">     <em><strong>Repulsor Gauntlet.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> Your spell attack bonus to hit, one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d10 + 3) force damage.</span></p><p><span dir=\"ltr\">     <em><strong>Mobile Configuration. </strong></em>Your speed increases to 40 feet and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage. Additionally, while in this configuration, you have a 40-foot climbing speed and a 40-foot swimming speed. Additionally, at 8th level, you gain a 40-foot flying speed.</span></p><p><span dir=\"ltr\">     <em><strong>Turret Configuration. </strong></em>Your movement speed becomes 0 while in this configuration. Additionally, when you use the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. Lastly, your Photon Cannon is replaced by the following:</span></p><p><span dir=\"ltr\">     <em><strong>Photon Turret.</strong></em> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack: </em>Your spell attack bonus to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d10) radiant damage.</span></p><p><span dir=\"ltr\">     Additionally, starting at 6th level, while transformed in any Configuration, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p><h3><span dir=\"ltr\">Speaker of Steel</span></h3><p><span dir=\"ltr\">At 6th level, your empathy for constructs allows you to persuade their programming to your side. As a result, constructs can be charmed by you, even if they would otherwise be immune to being charmed. Additionally, if you cast the <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.hDOENzjuj5WpLq7B]{animal friendship}</em> spell, you can target a construct with the spell.</span></p><h3><span dir=\"ltr\">Stalker Configuration</span></h3><p><span dir=\"ltr\">Starting at 10th level, you gain a Configuration optimized for stealth and subterfuge. As a bonus action, you can activate a cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, or cast a spell. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again on the following round.<br />      Additionally, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in this form and you gain the following action, in addition to your Photon Cannon:</span></p><p><span dir=\"ltr\">     <em><strong>Antimatter Dagger. </strong>Melee Weapon Attack: </em>Your spell attack bonus to hit, one target. <em>Hit: </em>5 (1d4 + 3) necrotic damage. Once per turn, you deal an extra 14 (4d6) damage if you have advantage on the attack roll, or if the target is within 5 feet of one of your allies that isn't incapacitated and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</span></p><h3><span dir=\"ltr\">Mecha Transformation</span></h3><p><span dir=\"ltr\">Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to switch to an empowered version of your Juggernaut Configuration: a towering Mecha Configuration. While in this form, you have all the benefits of being in your Juggernaut Configuration, except you retain your photon cannon attack option and you subtract 4 from all damage you take, instead of 2. In addition, you become Large size, have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and can use your bonus action to make two melee weapon additional attacks when you take the Attack action.<br />      You can remain in this configuration for up to 10 minutes. Once you enter this configuration, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Dark Matter pg. 85","identifier":"circle-of-configuration","classIdentifier":"druid","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.7UXSmBe3DCMHh2bn"},"cf":{"id":"temp_bh1nmm70whp"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1669153403479,"modifiedTime":1675963962536,"lastModifiedBy":"O6whcBaQIegOr7mL"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"nnq0pSfWUAzHlmdb"}
