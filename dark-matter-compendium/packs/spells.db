It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, temperatures, and cosmic signals appropriate to the thing being depicted. You can't, however, create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.<br>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of an asteroid, you can make it rotate on its axis. Similarly, you can cause the image to make different sounds at different times.<br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. The image does, however, fool sensor systems. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

This area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves within the area, it takes [[/r 2d6]] force damage for every 5 feet it travels.<br>As a reaction when a creature moves directly in front of the area of spikes, out to a distance of 30 feet, you can cause them to explode outward, peppering the target with spikes and ending the spell. Each creature within 30-foot long, 10-foot wide line originating from the spikes must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 4d6]] force damage, or half as much on a successful save.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"DaM pg. 272","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":10,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":0,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":60,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["2d6","force"],["4d6","force"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"dex","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":2,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"an emerald ring worth 30 gp","consumed":false,"cost":30,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"quickDamage":{"context":{"0":"","1":""},"value":{"0":true,"1":true}},"quickOther":{"context":"","value":true},"critRange":{"value":null},"critDamage":{"value":""},"quickDesc":{"value":true},"quickSave":{"value":true},"quickProperties":{"value":true},"quickVersatile":{"value":false},"quickFlavor":{"value":true},"quickCharges":{"value":{"use":false}}}},"img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/icons/black/nails.svg","effects":[],"_id":"ys4D25mcTV2f1xT4"}
