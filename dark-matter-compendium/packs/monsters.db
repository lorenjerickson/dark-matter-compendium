Though they might seem like lumbering, enormous creatures, content to harass their targets with a nearly boundless supply of hellfire rockets, the surgically embedded thrusters on their backs make them surprisingly nimble.

Their evil is boundless and chaotic, yet disquietingly familiar, as if it were born from all the failings of the Material Plane. There seems to be some truth to this notion, for as humanoids clawed their way to the stars and surrounded themselves with great machines and forests of steel, demons changed as well, incorporating savage mechanistic enhancements into their already corrupt forms. These mechademons are doom incarnate, the fate awaiting the soul of every evil individual who dies among the stars.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"94\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Evil Enhanced.</span></span> <p>Evil Enhanced.

With little more than bolts, jagged blades, and drops of infernal blood, mechademons can add their own 'improvements' to a humanoid that they capture, replacing body parts with machines and utterly corrupting the subject's mind. Mechademons revel in the opportunity for torturous indoctrination, even if the resulting foot soldiers are little more than cannon- fodder.

Often, an eternal dragon will hide its hoard on a small moon or a large asteroid, hollowing out enormous caverns to form its lair.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The kobolds that dwell in an eternal dragon's planetoid lair often venerate their dragon as a god.

A few wizmos might get away with petty theft, graffiti, pushing random buttons on arcane terminals, and rearranging furniture, while larger groups will tend towards lighting things on fire, throwing trash in Dark Matter engines, replacing blasters with bananas (and vice-versa), and kidnapping (though the victim is usually released quickly).</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Though wizmos aren't clever individually, they're practically devious in a mob. Wizmos communicate with rapid chirps of beeps and boops, such that a whole mob of wizmos sounds like a chittering buzz.

They'll follow their master anywhere, whether or not their master wants them at their side, and they'll even heed commands, to an extent (though their execution of said commands is bumbling at best). In the best case, their chaotic tendencies might be focused on something productive, but in the worst case, they'll drive their master mad before moving on and finding another one.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"243\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Constructed Nature.</span></span> <p>A wizmo doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"244\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wizmo Imprint</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A mob of wizmos can decide that someone would make a suitable master for any reason and will imprint upon them after a long moment of entranced admiration. This individual becomes the wizmos' master.</p><p>Once a mob has imprinted on a master, it is extraordinarily difficult to escape them. Wizmos are designed by the fey and therefore know a number of convoluted ways to slip between the planes and return to their master's side, appearing the instant their master thinks they are at last alone. If their master leaves the wizmos behind, even if their master is on another plane of existence, the wizmos will appear nearby their master after one minute, unless doing so would place them in grave danger.</p><p>A mob of wizmos will accept general commands (such as to guard a corridor or retrieve an item) issued by their master as a bonus action, but will not necessarily enact them. When such a command is given, roll a d20. On a roll of 14 or higher, the wizmos obey the command to the best of their ability. On a roll of 6 or lower, the wizmos fail to obey the command whatsoever, and instead do something totally unrelated to the command. On a roll of 7 to 13, the wizmos attempt to obey the command, but get confused and do something similar to the command. For example, if a mob of wizmos is tasked to retrieve a concussion grenade, they might instead return with a fruit of similar dimensions, or they might return with the grenade, without its pin, moments from detonating.</p><p>A mob of wizmos in service of a master will repair itself each day at dawn, restoring all its lost hit points.</p><p>Though they are quick to forgive their master's rudeness and indiscretions (as well as the behavior of their master's allies), the wizmos will leave and never return if their master or their allies attack them.</p></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic neutral","race":"","type":{"value":"construct","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"DaM pg. 247","class":{},"gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":["poison"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["blinded","deafened","exhaustion","paralyzed","petrified","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"understands Common but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dat":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"pil":{"value":0,"ability":"dex"},"tec":{"value":0,"ability":"int"}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Ma2rSaWGqA5d2oGk":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Wizmo","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":0.5,"height":0.5,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/blank.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":10,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1666898427549,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"}}

Bluescreen swarms can ravage an entire ship, attacking anyone that so much as carries technology or approaches a terminal.

While repairs are being made, the terrified crew watches the body of an immense var'zuul creep by, slowly blotting out a swath of stars behind its colossal frame.

These bands give the worms their unsettling motion, but it is the strange, luminescent fluid contained in pustules throughout the body that somehow lets the var'zuul slither though empty space like water. This fluid resists motion in space, as if it pulls against an unseen force when it is moved, but loses this property shortly after the worm dies. The underlying physics (or magic) behind this phenomenon is baffling to science.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Moreover, var'zuul are capable of digesting almost any living matter, but are also capable of subsisting on the radiation prevalent in empty space.

Once a force of tripods lands, they set about indiscriminately exterminating all life they encounter in a bid to conquer the entire planet and claim its most precious resource: water.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"214\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Machine Invaders.</span></span> <p>Clearly, the tripods are designed with alien and hostile intent, but beyond that, they are an enigma. Atop their three flexible legs—nearly 40 feet high—rests a domed chassis and menacing central eye, bright as a spotlight. This light is merely a precursor to the tripod's mounted laser cannon, which can reduce a man to ash in mere seconds. If an enemy wanders too close, the tripod can also produce a number of long tendrils to ensnare and capture its victim.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Within, their mechanics are incomprehensible—they have no guiding system remotely like a construct core; instead, every surface is covered with a thick layer of their red moss. Should the moss be critically poisoned, or the tripod be unable to refresh it with enough water, the tripod falls into a perpetually dormant state, to be awoken only by some later threat. By that strange metric, it seems almost reasonable to state that the moss is in fact controlling the tripods, if such a thing is truly possible.</p><p>Each tripod is capable of manufacturing more of its kind, producing them at a rate of about one tripod every seven days, provided it can find sufficient materials. After landing, a small number of tripods can quickly swell to an invading army of terrible power. However, tripods only seem to replicate once they have cleared enough room for the red moss to proliferate far ahead of them, and only pause to replicate if they have encountered stern resistance.</p></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"215\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Curious Red Moss.</span></span> <p>Damp, vascular, and fibrous, this crimson moss clings to every surface in the tripod's wake. It drinks deep of whatever water it encounters, spreading rapidly up riverbanks and along coastlines, choking other plants and vegetation with its roots.

These mechademons are doom incarnate, the fate awaiting the soul of every evil individual who dies among the stars.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"88\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Evil Enhanced.</span></span> <p>Evil Enhanced. Every mechademon is unique, having surgically inserted brutalistic machines into their bodies to upgrade themselves in various ways. Usually, this makes them tougher, more agile, and purpose-built for cruelty. For example, a razor-sharp forearm blade won't be more useful in combat than a dagger, but it's lovely for torture.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"89\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Indoctrination.</span></span> <p>It is always better to be killed than to be captured by a cadre of mechademons, for they can do far worse than maim. With little more than bolts, jagged blades, and drops of infernal blood, mechademons can add their own 'improvements' to a humanoid that they capture, replacing body parts with machines and utterly corrupting the subject's mind. Mechademons revel in the opportunity for torturous indoctrination, even if the resulting foot soldiers are little more than cannon- fodder. The demons well understand that watching one's friend turn into a monster is enough to break the will of most any mortal that would resist them.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"any race","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":0.5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":100},"source":"DaM pg. 220","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened","poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["abyssal"],"custom":"one language it knew before indoctrination"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dat":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"pil":{"value":0,"ability":"dex"},"tec":{"value":0,"ability":"int"}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Ma2rSaWGqA5d2oGk":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Indoctrinated","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/blank.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1666898521434,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"}}

Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp; Age</em>. Avia-Ra are long lived, and due to their long lives, they have been revered as gods by more primitive beings. They reach maturity at roughly 30 years of age, and can live as long as 500 years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Alignment</em>. The avia-ra draw their morality and philosophy from the sun. Though this solar religion can be severe, fatalistic, and dogmatic, most avia-ra have an inclination towards good—or at least lawful—alignments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Size</em>. Avia-Ra stand between 5 and 6 feet in height, and weigh roughly 120 to 170 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Speed</em>. You have a base walking speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Darkvision</em>. Thanks to the rituals of your ancestors, the light of the sun dances in your eyes and grants you superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

old spacers gather at hearthstations to tell stories of the strange things they've seen in the 'verse (as they often do), someone invariably mentions the gigapods, often misnamed 'the moon eaters.' These sprawling, vast amalgamations of tentacles and strange organs are as alien as anything can be, for they lack anything even resembling a singular body, head, or central point. Indeed, their bizarre lifecycle and incomprehensible anatomy points to an origin outside the fringes of civilized space.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"68\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Planetary Gestation.</span></span> <p>Gigapods have a number of special tentacles, each equipped with a solitary gigaseed that does not regrow once detached. Descending on small planetoids, moons, and asteroids large enough to harbor a warm core, the gigapods bore an enormous seed-bearing tentacle deep into the hot mantle, where the seed is deposited. In the heat, the seed swells to an incredible size and, through completely unknown mechanisms, metamorphoses into a young gigapod. Once it is large enough, the gigapod hatches from the planetoid, smashing it like an egg.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Gigaseeds are curiously small—less than two feet in diameter—but are best regarded as weapons comparable to arcane warheads. A gigaseed can seemingly last indefinitely before being hatched within a planetoid's core to wreak utter devastation when it emerges. In the wrong hands, a single seed delivered by a large drill or sophisticated teleportation spell can lay waste to an entire world.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"69\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adopters.</span></span> <p>When a gigapod has used all of its seeds, its demeanor transforms completely. Young gigapods wander the 'verse in search of new planetoids, violently attacking interlopers that draw too near, while older gigapods are more curious of ships and creatures they encounter and have even been known to 'adopt' smaller creatures, which they perhaps even view as surrogate children. When a gigapod adopts a creature, it is violently protective, striking out against others that endanger or even crowd too close to their surrogate child.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"70\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Across the Black Ocean.</span></span> <p>Nothing discovered in the 'verse begins to compare with the biology of the gigapod, leaving only a few possible origins. Perhaps a lone gigaseed was flung at incredible speeds by a climactic event in a far-off galaxy, propelling across the Black Ocean, the expanse of empty space between galaxies. Most scholars believe this to be the most likely scenario, but the other possibilities are just as likely and far more terrifying.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>It is possible that gigapods are the result of bizarre magical tampering with the fabric of the universe. Perhaps, the gigapods originate from a foreign dimension, not simply a far-off galaxy. If that were the case, far more of these creatures might reside far closer than anyone could have anticipated; merely a spell away, in a dimension where the laws of physics differ from our own. To open a portal to this dimension, if it indeed exists, could be devastating for all life in the 'verse.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"71\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Emergence Event</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Planting and hatching a gigaseed should be a pivotal moment in a campaign. Once a seed is embedded within a planet's hot core, it lays dormant for precisely 26 years as it grows and develops into a young gigapod. This intervening period is marked by increasingly turbulent volcanic activity, earthquakes, and cataclysmic storms, giving adventurers time to plan out how best to save the world and its inhabitants, whether by evacuation, magical intervention, or a daring expedition to the planet's core. Moreover, it presents a rigidly ticking clock for the campaign's action. When the time is at last up, the gigapod explodes forth from the planet's core, ripping a hole hundreds of miles across on the planet's surface and devastating all life on it.</p></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"neutral","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":6,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":2300},"source":"DaM pg. 215","class":{},"gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["deep"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dat":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"pil":{"value":0,"ability":"dex"},"tec":{"value":0,"ability":"int"}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Ma2rSaWGqA5d2oGk":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Young Gigapod","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/blank.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":10000,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1666898409290,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"}}

created all at once, their gears and pistons conjured perfectly into place within a sturdy frame of light. They serve their masters dutifully, but, despite their ingenious designs and innovative material, all hardlight constructs suffer from a critical flaw: in time, they eventually dissipate into nothingness.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conjured and Constructed</em>. Hardlight constructs can only be created by spellcasters of exceptional talent and imagination. Creating compressed light on its own is easy enough&mdash;even wizarding apprentices can conjure simple geometrical constructs&mdash;but creating a mechanical device from hardlight requires envisioning in detail every component of the schematic all at once during the casting. Even a second of distraction can destroy the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when successfully completed, the hardlight construct is a mechanical servant brought into being all at once. Like an automaton, it is capable of following commands and acting autonomously, albeit with extremely limited creativity. However, hardlight is an inadequate material for extended durations, for it radiates away with time. The dim glow given off by all hardlight constructs is the gradual dissipation of the material, which eventually fades out of existence.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ring Core</em>. As all constructs require a core, hardlight constructs are innately tied to the emerald rings used by their masters to cast the spell. The spellcaster's ring flies forth into the construct and becomes the core, using the facets of its gem as circuits and logic gates. If this ring is removed from the construct, the hardlight dissipates instantly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Constructed Nature</em>.

old spacers gather at hearthstations to tell stories of the strange things they've seen in the 'verse (as they often do), someone invariably mentions the gigapods, often misnamed 'the moon eaters.' These sprawling, vast amalgamations of tentacles and strange organs are as alien as anything can be, for they lack anything even resembling a singular body, head, or central point. Indeed, their bizarre lifecycle and incomprehensible anatomy points to an origin outside the fringes of civilized space.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"72\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Planetary Gestation.</span></span> <p>Gigapods have a number of special tentacles, each equipped with a solitary gigaseed that does not regrow once detached. Descending on small planetoids, moons, and asteroids large enough to harbor a warm core, the gigapods bore an enormous seed-bearing tentacle deep into the hot mantle, where the seed is deposited. In the heat, the seed swells to an incredible size and, through completely unknown mechanisms, metamorphoses into a young gigapod. Once it is large enough, the gigapod hatches from the planetoid, smashing it like an egg.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Gigaseeds are curiously small—less than two feet in diameter—but are best regarded as weapons comparable to arcane warheads. A gigaseed can seemingly last indefinitely before being hatched within a planetoid's core to wreak utter devastation when it emerges.

Young gigapods wander the 'verse in search of new planetoids, violently attacking interlopers that draw too near, while older gigapods are more curious of ships and creatures they encounter and have even been known to 'adopt' smaller creatures, which they perhaps even view as surrogate children. When a gigapod adopts a creature, it is violently protective, striking out against others that endanger or even crowd too close to their surrogate child.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"74\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Across the Black Ocean.</span></span> <p>Nothing discovered in the 'verse begins to compare with the biology of the gigapod, leaving only a few possible origins. Perhaps a lone gigaseed was flung at incredible speeds by a climactic event in a far-off galaxy, propelling across the Black Ocean, the expanse of empty space between galaxies. Most scholars believe this to be the most likely scenario, but the other possibilities are just as likely and far more terrifying.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>It is possible that gigapods are the result of bizarre magical tampering with the fabric of the universe. Perhaps, the gigapods originate from a foreign dimension, not simply a far-off galaxy. If that were the case, far more of these creatures might reside far closer than anyone could have anticipated; merely a spell away, in a dimension where the laws of physics differ from our own.

A few wizmos might get away with petty theft, graffiti, pushing random buttons on arcane terminals, and rearranging furniture, while larger groups will tend towards lighting things on fire, throwing trash in Dark Matter engines, replacing blasters with bananas (and vice-versa), and kidnapping (though the victim is usually released quickly).</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Though wizmos aren't clever individually, they're practically devious in a mob. Wizmos communicate with rapid chirps of beeps and boops, such that a whole mob of wizmos sounds like a chittering buzz. This racket is how the wizmos form a swarm intelligence: their noisy shouting matches amount to their construct brains reasoning out complicated problems together. The larger the mob and the louder the racket, the longer a mob's attention span and the more elaborate their pranks.</p></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"246\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Master Seekers.</span></span> <p>When wizmos aren't vandalizing property, stealing things, or upsetting small animals, they are passively searching for a master to guide them. Perhaps their need to find a master traces back to their fey creator, or perhaps they were simply designed that way to more persistently annoy one individual at a time.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Regardless, once a group of wizmos imprint on an individual they deem suitable, they are quite inseparable. They'll follow their master anywhere, whether or not their master wants them at their side, and they'll even heed commands, to an extent (though their execution of said commands is bumbling at best). In the best case, their chaotic tendencies might be focused on something productive, but in the worst case, they'll drive their master mad before moving on and finding another one.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"247\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Constructed Nature.</span></span> <p>A wizmo doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"248\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wizmo Imprint</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A mob of wizmos can decide that someone would make a suitable master for any reason and will imprint upon them after a long moment of entranced admiration. This individual becomes the wizmos' master.</p><p>Once a mob has imprinted on a master, it is extraordinarily difficult to escape them. Wizmos are designed by the fey and therefore know a number of convoluted ways to slip between the planes and return to their master's side, appearing the instant their master thinks they are at last alone. If their master leaves the wizmos behind, even if their master is on another plane of existence, the wizmos will appear nearby their master after one minute, unless doing so would place them in grave danger.</p><p>A mob of wizmos will accept general commands (such as to guard a corridor or retrieve an item) issued by their master as a bonus action, but will not necessarily enact them. When such a command is given, roll a d20. On a roll of 14 or higher, the wizmos obey the command to the best of their ability. On a roll of 6 or lower, the wizmos fail to obey the command whatsoever, and instead do something totally unrelated to the command. On a roll of 7 to 13, the wizmos attempt to obey the command, but get confused and do something similar to the command. For example, if a mob of wizmos is tasked to retrieve a concussion grenade, they might instead return with a fruit of similar dimensions, or they might return with the grenade, without its pin, moments from detonating.</p><p>A mob of wizmos in service of a master will repair itself each day at dawn, restoring all its lost hit points.</p><p>Though they are quick to forgive their master's rudeness and indiscretions (as well as the behavior of their master's allies), the wizmos will leave and never return if their master or their allies attack them.</p></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic neutral","race":"","type":{"value":"construct","subtype":"swarm","swarm":"tiny","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":4,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1100},"source":"DaM pg. 248","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":["poison"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["bludgeoning","piercing","slashing"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["blinded","deafened","exhaustion","paralyzed","petrified","poisoned","prone","restrained","stunned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"understands Common but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dat":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"pil":{"value":0,"ability":"dex"},"tec":{"value":0,"ability":"int"}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Ma2rSaWGqA5d2oGk":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Wizmo Mob","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/blank.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":10,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1666898425973,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"}}

Wrothian ships are powerful, though not unassailable; however, their raids rarely meet organized resistance. Once the wroth land, they converge on a settlement with a force of takers and collector vats, overseen by a wrothian alpha or a primarch, and begin stealing away as many humanoids as possible. Then, they vanish just as quickly as they arrived, retreating untraceably with their prisoners into the Black.

For this reason, wrothians believe themselves to be perfect—no other lifeform is comparable. Whereas other races wither and die with age, the wroth live indefinitely. Whereas other races have feeble minds, wrothian primarchs possess vast intellects and psionic power.

The bio-matter of hundreds or thousands is returned to the ship, where an advanced creation matrix weaves together the molecules of a new, perfect organism.</p><p>These details, as well as the fact that wrothians are nourished by the constant hum of psionic energy on their ships, is wholly unknown to most.

created all at once, their gears and pistons conjured perfectly into place within a sturdy frame of light. They serve their masters dutifully, but, despite their ingenious designs and innovative material, all hardlight constructs suffer from a critical flaw: in time, they eventually dissipate into nothingness.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conjured and Constructed</em>. Hardlight constructs can only be created by spellcasters of exceptional talent and imagination. Creating compressed light on its own is easy enough&mdash;even wizarding apprentices can conjure simple geometrical constructs&mdash;but creating a mechanical device from hardlight requires envisioning in detail every component of the schematic all at once during the casting. Even a second of distraction can destroy the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when successfully completed, the hardlight construct is a mechanical servant brought into being all at once. Like an automaton, it is capable of following commands and acting autonomously, albeit with extremely limited creativity. However, hardlight is an inadequate material for extended durations, for it radiates away with time. The dim glow given off by all hardlight constructs is the gradual dissipation of the material, which eventually fades out of existence.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ring Core</em>. As all constructs require a core, hardlight constructs are innately tied to the emerald rings used by their masters to cast the spell. The spellcaster's ring flies forth into the construct and becomes the core, using the facets of its gem as circuits and logic gates. If this ring is removed from the construct, the hardlight dissipates instantly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Constructed Nature</em>.

Wrothian ships are powerful, though not unassailable; however, their raids rarely meet organized resistance. Once the wroth land, they converge on a settlement with a force of takers and collector vats, overseen by a wrothian alpha or a primarch, and begin stealing away as many humanoids as possible.

Whereas other races have feeble minds, wrothian primarchs possess vast intellects and psionic power.

The bio-matter of hundreds or thousands is returned to the ship, where an advanced creation matrix weaves together the molecules of a new, perfect organism.</p><p>These details, as well as the fact that wrothians are nourished by the constant hum of psionic energy on their ships, is wholly unknown to most.
