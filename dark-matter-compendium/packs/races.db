Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><em>Reconfigurable Ability Score Increase</em>. One ability score of your choice increases by 1, and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.</p><p><em>Age</em>. With the proper replacement parts and activities to occupy yourself, you can conceivably exist indefinitely. Vect are known to degrade and lose their sanity, however, if they live too long without an explicit purpose. It isn't known if this insanity visits all vect at old ages, or just those whose resolve wavers.</p><p><em>Alignment</em>. Vect possess mechanical minds, which find logic comforting. Generally, vect are lawful.</p><p><em>Size</em>. As constructs built by massive forges, the vect could conceivably be perfectly uniform, like the golems that preceded them. However, the Foundries are either inherently flawed, or otherwise have a fondness for making diverse vect units, for each created vect is in some way unique. Vect units stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and average about 150 to 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em>Speed</em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em>Thermalsight</em>. You gain thermalsight, which means you can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one-inch of any solid barrier.</p><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.races.1UOzF2yx5MKry5wT]{Construct Anatomy}</em>. Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to nonmagical diseases. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. You have advantage on saving throws you make against exhaustion. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You don't dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. You can still be placed into a torpor by sleep-inducing magic.</p><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.races.YrPNI1A9K731nhmD]{Inflexible Mind}</em>. Your mechanical mind is inherently logical and not easily swayed. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.</p><p><em>Embedded Armor</em>. You can install special armor plating directly onto your body. This embedded armor counts as a construct graft installed in the External slot.

Telepathy.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Wrothian Traits</h2><p>Almost completely uniform, wrothian takers that reject the primarchs have the following racial traits:</p><p><em>Ability Score Increase</em>. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma increases by 1.</p><p><em>Age</em>. All wrothians are synthetically engineered in a creation matrix, which rids them of the faults found in other organic lifeforms: they are ageless and don't require food or drink, as long as they are nourished by a field of psionic energy, such as those which encompass their ships. In exile from your ship, however, you will find no such nourishment, and will likely perish within 10 years.</p><p><em>Alignment</em>. Wrothians have always found the conceit of morality strange. After all, to their minds, all other life in the 'verse is simply beneath them, so empathy and other philosophical considerations are a waste of thought. As a rogue wrothian, you likely oppose the primarchs and their view, but a natural understanding of empathy might elude you, for your mind wasn't designed for it. Rogue wrothians can have alignments across the spectrum, but many skew toward evil out of habit.</p><p><em>Size</em>. All takers stand the same height—just over six feet tall—and are identical in every other dimension as well, though you might have some important defect that distinguishes you. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em>Speed</em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em>Darkvision</em>. Accustomed to the endless, inimitable Black, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.races.INGVyUtuT6Abp2uI]{Neural Lock}</em>. You can use your action to freeze the nervous system of a humanoid creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn. After you use your neural lock, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.races.C1Oe5NytiesZf956]{Razor Teeth}</em>. Your sharp claws and teeth are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing or piercing damage (your choice) equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p><p><em>Repletion</em>. In lieu of a true digestive system, your body is sustained by psionic energy it absorbed while aboard your ship. You don't need to eat or drink, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.</p><p><em>Telepathy</em>. You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.</p><p><em>Languages</em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and Wrothian. Wrothian is a language rarely spoken, and is written in complex, circular runes. Spoken aloud, it is a rhythmic language of rumbles, sibilants, and chirps, suited to a race with an articulate tongue.</p><p> </p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Dark Matter pg. 53","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1670175012446,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"}}

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p><em>Age</em>. Skathári reach maturity around 15 years of age and live for up to 150 years.</p><p><em>Alignment</em>. Skathári are fierce, impulsive fighters with an innate distrust of the outside world. They tend toward chaotic alignments.</p><p><em>Size</em>. Most adult skathári stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh upwards of 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em>Speed</em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em>Adaptive Metabolism</em>. Your body can quickly adapt to a range of extreme environments. You take no damage from the extreme temperatures of space and other harsh environments (see @UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.journals.KIk8unhUKSdtoAki.JournalEntryPage.K2WOMQCz4FD7p0Z7]{Appendix E: Hazards}), and you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 10 times your Constitution modifier (minimum of 10 minutes). Additionally, <strong>you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against inhaled poisons and gases</strong>.</p><p><em>Gliding Wings</em>. You have a pair of membranous wings that you can use to glide clumsily through the air. While falling, you can move up to 10 feet horizontally for every 5 feet you fall, up to your movement speed. Additionally, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage taken as a result of falling.</p><p><em>Powerful Build</em>. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.races.eMs8RobnibnWr4Ua]{Hooked Claws}</em>. Your digits end in short, hooked claws, which grant you a climbing speed of 20 feet. Additionally, you can choose for your unarmed strikes to deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</p><p><em>Regenerative</em>. If any part of your body is amputated, but its amputation doesn't kill you, you can fully regrow that part of your body in 24 hours.</p><p><em>Languages</em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and Skathári. Skathári is a choppy, syllabic language that uses many idioms and metaphors. This carries into other languages a skathári might speak; therefore, speaking to a skathári in any language is often a chore if one doesn’t know much about skathári culture.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Dark Matter pg. 49","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1670174644504,"lastModifiedBy":"7Bjdrf2PgSqfaCM3"}}

At its height, the nautilid race was a force to be feared, with a fleet that fought alongside the elves in the Crusades and an indomitable homeworld, named Poseidon for its endless oceans. Alas, this was never to last. When the cruel fires of their home star consumed Poseidon, the nautilid race was left adrift in their ships, searching for another world that could support them.</p><p>     Poseidon was a world of unique composition—a mixture of rare elements and gases was dissolved in its deep oceans. This liquid, known as the Poseidon Solution, is central to the nautilids’ biology. Though the nautilid possess great intelligence and are swift underwater, the Solution also allowed them to grow large, for minerals in the Solution facilitate extremely efficient gas transfer into their gills. Nautilids are technically amphibious, possessing both a set of lungs and gills, but venturing too long without the Solution makes respiration difficult. Thus, nautilids ships and aqua suits are filled with Poseidon Solution.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>By ancient tradition, nautilids are named in the old languages of Poseidon, and the second half of a nautilid’s name is composed of a surname, passed down the maternal line. The meaning of most of these names have been lost to history, much like Poseidon itself.</p><p>Nautilid Names. Agrias, Charax, Democedes, Gorgias, Helenos, Idomeneus, Isokrates, Lysandros, Monomachus, Panthous, Theomestros, Xenagoras</p><h2>Traits</h2><p>Your great, amphibious body and your constantly-worn aqua suit give you the following racial traits:</p><p><em>Ability Score Increase</em>. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p><p><em>Age</em>. Nautilids reach maturity by 20 years of age, and individuals have been recorded to live as long as 150 years.</p><p><em>Alignment</em>. Stoic and contemplative, nautilids tend to be lawful.</p><p><em>Size</em>. Lumbering and stout, nautilids stand between 6 and 8 feet tall, seeming even larger in their cumbersome aqua suits. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em>Speed</em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p><p><em>Amphibious</em>. You can breathe water as well as air, though breathing air is uncomfortable for you without assistance.</p><p><em>Powerful Build</em>. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><em>Deductive</em>. You have proficiency in the Investigation skill.</p><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.races.ec8sXsFpkNAtZR9Q]{Aqua Suit}</em>. Except when you are aboard a whorl ship, you wear a bulky aqua suit, which is filled with Poseidon Solution, in order to breathe comfortably. The suit covers your whole body, including a large domed helmet with circular windows that allow you to see without hindrance. Without the suit, you can breathe air or water, but doing so delivers air inefficiently to your lungs, and you feel much the same as a human does in very thin air. You can don or doff the helmet on your turn as part of your action, and you can don or doff the entire suit in 1 minute.</p><p>If damaged directly but not completely destroyed, the suit rapidly mends itself, leaking only a very small amount of water.</p><p>While wearing the suit, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Other armor can be fitted to attach around the aqua suit at no cost. While no other armor is fitted to it, you count as being unarmored for the purposes of features such as Unarmored Defense. Additionally, while wearing the suit, you have resistance to fire damage.</p><p>The suit counts as a life suit and is also equipped with an embedded <em>@UUID[Compendium.dark-matter-compendium.races.qJeJeGay22UJa9qj]{universal translator}</em> magic item, which you can use at will.</p><p><em>     Languages</em>.
